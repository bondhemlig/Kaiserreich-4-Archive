orth.1.t:0 "Faith and Nation"
orth.1.d:0 "Our Government's religious policies have been popular, both among our own people and abroad. They show how our Faith can bring order and stability to societies in this chaotic modern world.  There are now a variety of political groups in neighbouring countries following a new form of politicised Orthodox Christianity. A loose organisation, calling itself 'Faith and Nation', has grown within Russia and is training activists and paramilitaries from these organisations, with the aim of developing their principles and forming an international brotherhood of Orthodox nations.  While this could lead to international complications, it may provide an opportunity for Russia to acquire a firm position and role within the world once more."
