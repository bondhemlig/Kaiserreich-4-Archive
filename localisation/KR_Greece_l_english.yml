greece.1.d:0 "During a particularly heated debate in parliament over how to recover from the economic hardships, Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos dropped dead on the spot! Already crowds have gathered in many major cities to hold tribute to him. This truly is a dark day for Greece."
greece.1.a:0 "God is with us!"
#greece.1.b:0 "Let us open an investigation."
#greece.2.t:0 "Investigation into the Death"
#greece.2.d:0 "The police are now raiding the homes of suspected terrorists, political enemies, and former criminals. We have come up with several leads, but so far all have proved inconclusive. We must focus our efforts on one group for our investigation to be effective, although this may lead to false conviction."
#greece.2.a:0 "Arrest prominent Legionaries and have them interrogated"
#greece.2.b:0 "Raid the offices of the Syndicalists"
#greece.2.c:0 "Keep Searching!"
#greece.4.t:0 "Parliamentary Crisis!"
#greece.4.d:0 "With the death of Prime Minister Venizelos, the governmental forces of this country have fallen into crisis. The Grand Coalition leading the Hellenic Parliament has dissolved, and the King has called an emergency session to decide the fate of this nation. Some are pushing for a new Prime Minister to be appointed by the King, while others are demanding an election be held within 70 days. Still, the King can activate his emergency powers and dissolve parliament for the time being..."
greece.5.t:0 "Bulgaria is broken!"
greece.5.d:0 "When the Weltkrieg ended Bulgaria had seized full control over central macedonia and Thrace from us, and now we have brought this land back under our flag. We are one step closer to unifying the greek peoples under a single flag."
greece.5.a:0 "Perhaps we should dust off the Megali idea..."
greece.6.t:0 "Independence Day and the Annunciation Feast"
greece.6.d:0 "In 1821, Greeks rose up against the oppressive Ottoman Empire which had occupied Greece for nearly four hundred years. Bishop Germanos of Patras boldly raised the Greek flag at the monastery of Agia Lavras, inciting the Greek revolution. While the exact date probably was not March 25th, it did occur in late March and it was gradually associated with the religious feast of the Annunciation which occurs on the same date. On the day of the Feast of the Annunciation the archangel Gabriel appeared to the maiden Mary and announced the news: she was pregnant with the divine child. Bishop Germanos chose this day to deliver a different but not unrelated message: a new spirit was about to be born in Greece."
greece.6.a:0 "A New Spirit Shall Be Born!"
