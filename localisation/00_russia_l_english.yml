RUS_DEM_ADM2:0 "Encourage Local Search of Resources"
RUS_DEM_ADM2_desc:0 "With strong communes established across our nation we should give them directives to search for and exploit natural resources in their own regions. Few know these places as well as the locals, after all."

RUS_DEM_IND1:0 "Industrialisation"
RUS_DEM_IND1_desc:0 "By industrializing the far reaches of our country side we do not only make sure our whole nation stays alive, but also that targeting our industries becomes much more difficult for our enemies."
RUS_DEM_IND2:0 "Enrichment of The Russians"
RUS_DEM_IND2_desc:0 "Russia has a massive amount of minority groups and languages within our single nation. If we can make them all feel Russian while still maintaining their unique cultural identities it would enrich all of Russia. We must also make sure our countryside regions do not stagnate due to lacking industrialization."
RUS_DEM_IND3:0 "Agricultural Innovations"
RUS_DEM_IND3_desc:0 "In the eyes of the rest of the world, Russia is considered a backwards, poor country. We will show them that they are wrong, harnessing the massive resources hidden in the countryside through new technologies."
RUS_DEM_POL1:0 "Reinforce Governmental Power"
RUS_DEM_POL1_desc:0 "Freedom of thought, speech and organization are all fine and well, but in a nation dominated by chaos these matter little. The government must resume control of the cities, the factories and the countryside. "
RUS_DEM_POL2:0 "Encourage Free Thought"

RUS_DEM_POL3:0 "A Tolerant Republic"
RUS_DEM_POL3_desc:0 "The modern Russian republic does not trample the minorities of its own nation. It encourages their culture, history and languages, building unity in our love for freedom and democracy rather than from the fear of a God or a Tsar."
RUS_DEM_POL4:0 "Defend Democracy"
RUS_DEM_POL4_desc:0 "Russia is quickly becoming recognized as the bastion of Democracy, but things don't look so well elsewhere in the world. It is our duty to defend democratic movements in other nations, lest they all fall to autocrats until our nation is surrounded by enemies."

RUS_CON_ADM2:0 "Educate the Masses"
RUS_CON_ADM2_desc:0 "The Russian nation, torn apart by social and political unrest, has been unable to initiate any massive education programs successfully. There's still a large rural, analphabetic population dominating the countryside. A school in every village!"
RUS_CON_ADM3:0 "National Administration School"
RUS_CON_ADM3_desc:0 "With the new bureaucracy steadily growing we should set up a National Administration School which prepares our future army of bureaucrats for the necessary work ahead of them."

RUS_CON_IND2_desc:0 "A majority of all Russian farms in the nation are still worked on with hands and hooves. This has kept Russian economy stagnated for long enough, a large state-sponsored mechanization must be initiated!"
RUS_CON_IND3:0 "Create New Factories"
RUS_CON_IND3_desc:0 "With the much needed mechanization initiated we should set up new factories. With less and less farmhands needed on the countryside we can put these young, able men to work at our factory lines."
RUS_CON_POL1:0 "A New Constitution"
RUS_CON_POL1_desc:0 "With the monarch in place we would need a new constitution which clearly outlines the amount of influence the monarch should have in comparison to the senate and the duma. This is a time of change and many voices wish to be heard."
RUS_CON_POL2:0 "Imperial Free Academies"
RUS_CON_POL2_desc:0 "As our constitution guarantees some rights for our citizens, the state control of the academia has loosened up. This allows scientists, no matter of their political background, to focus solely on their research without having to fear the secret police."

russia.1.t:0 "A troubled History"
russia.1.d:0 "At the Congress of Omsk in April 1919, the White Generals agreed to form a united political front behind Alexander Kerensky and the remaining forces of the Provisional Government.  The united White forces, joined by the republic of Finland, made considerable gains, but the Red Army was still too strong and well placed, dominating the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. But soon the German empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites in exchange for the recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By September 1921, both Moscow and St. Petersburg had fallen to the White forces and a new Russian Republic was established in the old Imperial capital of St. Petersburg. For the past fifteen years, the leading parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. \n\n More specifically, 1936 is yet another dark time for Russia. The recent decision of the German Empire to push forward payment of reparations agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty, is forcing Russia to enact drastical reductions in budget for the armed forces and the existing social system. Such financial austerity, even if needed, combined with stagnation of economy has brought the ire of the nation and pushed country to the verge of general unrests. With government barely controlling the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg, let alone the rest of the country, things are looking bad for Russia. However, other political forces are growing, and considering whether it is now time for a change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."

russia.2.t:0 "The Russian Constitution of 1918"

The executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every six years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers."

russia.3.d:0 "During the Berlin Conference in November 1935, the Germans decided to force us to repay the remaining part of the Weltkrieg war indemnities (agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk treaty in 1918) one year earlier than expected, which has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutonics, the cabinet sees no other alternative than imposing harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state’s support. Our citizens are already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets, the Rightist Social Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Aleksandr Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."
russia.3.a:0 "We must increase austerity measures."

russia.4.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.4.d:0 "With stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions of our citizens during 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash, only available option to amass sufficient capital to help our economy, was to force the Russian state to prematurely repay the remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Berlin conference in november 1935 president Alexander Kerensky together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastical austerity measures the russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
