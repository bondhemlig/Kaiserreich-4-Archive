### Event text ###
russia.1.t:0 "A troubled History"
russia.1.d:0 "At the Congress of Omsk in April 1919, the White Generals agreed to form a united political front behind Alexander Kerensky and the remaining forces of the Provisional Government.  The united White forces, joined by the republic of Finland, made considerable gains, but the Red Army was still too strong and well placed, dominating the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. But soon the German empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites in exchange for the recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By September 1921, both Moscow and St. Petersburg had fallen to the White forces and a new Russian Republic was established in the old Imperial capital of St. Petersburg. For the past fifteen years, the leading parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. \n\n More specifically, 1936 is yet another dark time for Russia. The recent decision of the German Empire to push forward payment of reparations agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty, is forcing Russia to enact drastical reductions in budget for the armed forces and the existing social system. Such financial austerity, even if needed, combined with stagnation of economy has brought the ire of the nation and pushed country to the verge of general unrests. With government barely controlling the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg, let alone the rest of the country, things are looking bad for Russia. However, other political forces are growing, and considering whether it is now time for a change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."
russia.1.a:0 "Long live Russia, one and indivisible!"

russia.2.t:0 "The Russian Constitution of 1918"
russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1918, roughly a year after the fall of Nikolai II, the Russian constitution defines the country's political institutions. The legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate, consisting of senior nobles, statemen, and scholars. The executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every six years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers."
russia.2.a:0 "The constitution guarantees freedom and stability!"

russia.3.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.3.d:0 "During the Berlin Conference in November 1935, the Germans decided to force us to repay the remaining part of the Weltkrieg war indemnities (agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk treaty in 1918) one year earlier than expected, which has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutonics, the cabinet sees no other alternative than imposing harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state’s support. Our citizens are already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets, the Rightist Social Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Aleksandr Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."
russia.3.a:0 "We must increase austerity measures."

russia.4.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.4.d:0 "With stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions of our citizens during 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash, only available option to amass sufficient capital to help our economy, was to force the Russian state to prematurely repay the remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Berlin conference in november 1935 president Alexander Kerensky together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastical austerity measures the russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
russia.4.a:0 "Excellent!"

russia.5.t:0 "The Assassination of Kerensky"
russia.5.d:0 "The President of the Russian Republic, Alexander Kerensky has been assassinated! While president Kerensky was being slowly driven in a car through the streets of Petrograd, an unknown gunman stepped from the streets and shot the president and his chauffeur with a Mauser C96 semiautomatic pistol, despite immediate aid, Kerensky died, eyes open, slumped backwards in the seat of his car."

russia.6.t:0 "The Aftermath of the Assassination of Kerensky"
