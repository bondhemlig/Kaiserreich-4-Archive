### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_AUGUSTO_CESAR_SANDINO_DESC:0 "Augusto César Sandino has become more myth than man in Centroamérica.

POLITICS_FARABUNDO_MARTI_DESC:0 "Farabundo Martí is the Syndicalist former leader of then semi-autonomous El Salvador. He seeks to transform Centroamérica into a bastion of Communard style syndicalism. With syndicalist success at the Socialist Congressional Union, his dream may yet come to fruition."
