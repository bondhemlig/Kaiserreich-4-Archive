kr.political.24.t:0 "Kaiserreich Alpha 0.9.2"
kr.political.24.d:0 "The Kaiserreich Team proudly present Kaiserreich alpha version 0.9.2 for Hearts of Iron 4! Our team has been working hard from every corner of the world to bring this updated version to you. We hope you will enjoy playing it as much as we did making it.\n\nYou should also be aware that the mod is designed with the assumption that the player will always annex all possible states in peace treaties, so you should make sure to do that! We'd also like to remind you this mod is still in Alpha, so expect bugs, crashes and various headaches. If you encounter any of these, please report them on our GitHub bug tracker. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask us, but please check the in game FAQ first.\n\nEnjoy!\n                - The KR4 Team, team list found in the credits"
kr.political.24.a:0 "Thank you Kaiserreich team!"
kr.political.24.c:0 "Do you guys have a super useful FAQ?"
kr.political.24.e:0 "Something is missing..."

kr.political.25.t:0 "FAQ"
kr.political.25.d:0 "How come I can't puppet anything?\n    All puppetting is now done via events or focuses rather than through peace conferences.\n\nWhen will the next patch come out?\n    We aim for one big release every three months and of course hot-fixes wherever needed.\n\nWhy are some of the models black?\n    We use some DLC assets in our mod, so if you don't have that DLC, you will get blank textures, don't worry though, they are just cosmetic errors. We are working on setting up backup textures to avoid this, so keep an eye out for updates.\n\nI want to do bug testing/art/music/coding for KR, where can I sign up?\n    Wonderful! Head to our discord and check out the #rules_and_recruits channel.\n\nUpdate X broke my saves!\n    That isn't a question, but if you are having issues, try loading the save, saving again straight away without unpausing, then reloading using that new save. Not using ironman can also sometimes also help. If all else fails, remember past version are available for download on the KR4 forums.\n\nAre there any other parts to KR4?\n    We have three offical music mods, which can all be found in the steam workshop description. You should definitely go get them."

kr.political.26.t:0 "A Quick Word About Game Rules"
kr.political.26.d:0 "All the normal options found in these starting events have been moved to the wonderful game options added in 1.6.\n\nYou can now select the frequency of news events and what naming system states and VP's use, among other things. Isn't that fancy?"
kr.political.26.a:0 "It sure is, thanks!"

kr.political.27.t:0 "Ironclad and DLC"
kr.political.27.d:0 "Do I need Man the Guns? What about Waking the Tiger and Death or Dishonour? Will the universe end in vacuum decay?\n\nNo, you do not need Man the Guns or any other DLC to play Kaiserreich, though yes the universe will end in vacuum decay.\n\nThat being said, if you do have DLC by all means use it and enjoy those shiny unit models and associated features!"
kr.political.27.a:0 "Thanks for all the info, but can I please play now?"

kr.political.28.t:0 "Something is missing..."
kr.political.28.d:0 "Looking for the April fools joke? Looking to remove faction joining limits?\n\nThey are being moved to sub mods! Check out the Kaiserreich collection on the steam workshop, coming soonTM, to get them!"
kr.political.28.a:0 "Got it!"
