### Starting Events ###
kr.political.24.t:0 "Kaiserreich Alpha 0.7.2"
kr.political.24.d:0 "The Kaiserreich Team proudly present Kaiserreich alpha version 0.7.2 for Hearts of Iron 4! For months now our team has worked from every corner of the world to bring this mod to you. We hope you will enjoy playing it as much as we did making it. You should also be aware that the mod is designed with the assumption that the player will always annex all possible states in peace treaties, so you should make sure to do that!\n\nWe'd also like to remind you this is still Alpha, so expect bugs, crashes and various headaches. If (...when...) you encounter any of these, please report them on our GitHub bug tracker. If you have any other questions, don't hesitate to ask us, but please check the in game FAQ first.\n\nEnjoy!\n                - The KR4 Team, team list found in the credits"
kr.political.24.a:0 "Thank you Kaiserreich team!"
kr.political.24.c:0 "Do you guys have a super useful FAQ?"
kr.political.24.e:0 "Something is missing..."

kr.political.25.t:0 "FAQ"
kr.political.25.d:0 "How come I can't puppet anything?\nAll puppetting is now done via events or focuses rather than through peace conferences.\n\nWhen will the next patch come out?\nWe aim for one big release every three months, and of course hot-fixes wherever needed.\n\nWhy are some of the models black?\nWe use some DLC assets in our mod, so if you don't have that DLC, you will get blank textures, don't worry though, they are just cosmetic errors. We are working on setting up backup textures to avoid this, so keep an eye out for updates.\n\nI want to do bug testing/art/music/coding for KR, where can I sign up?\nWonderful! Head to our discord, link on the forums, and message Zankoas.\n\nUpdate X broke my saves!\nThat isn't a question, but if you are having issues, try loading the save, saving again straight away without unpausing, then reloading using that new save. Not using ironman can also sometimes also help. If all else fails, remember past version are available for download on the KR4 forums.\n\nAre there any other parts to KR4?\nThe only other part is the music mod, which can be found in the steam workshop description or on the forums. You should definitely go get it."
kr.political.25.a:0 "Do you have to take that PP away?"

kr.political.26.t:0 "News Events"
kr.political.26.d:0 "This is the president of the International News Tribune speaking. Kaiserreich is a mod deeply entrenched in lore and storytelling, conveyed through events, national focuses and other means. However, as the player, you might not even realise this, because most of the happenings in foreign countries are unknown to your eyes. Therefore we have created a system of news events that tell you about the major events that happened recently in other countries. They contain titbits of lore to help you understand the meaning and reasons for the events of the world, and they are also pretty and stuff.\n\nHowever, you may be a game tester or have a serious addiction with this being your 1000th game this week, or just a player who doesn't want popups in your face all the time, so you also have the option to turn this feature off entirely or allow only the important news events to fire. It's your choice..."
kr.political.26.a:0 "I want to know everything, EVERYTHING!"
kr.political.26.b:0 "Only inform me about major events."
kr.political.26.c:0 "I want none of this nonsense."
