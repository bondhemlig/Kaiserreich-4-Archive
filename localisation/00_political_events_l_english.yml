 kr.political.24.t:0 "Kaiserreich Alpha 0.1"
 kr.political.24.d:0 "The Kaiserreich Team proudly presents the Alpha 0.1 of our Kaiserreich HOI4 project.\n For months now, our team has worked from every corner of the world to bring you the product you are now playing. We hope you will enjoy it as much as we do.\n First off, there are several things we'd like to point out regarding our new mechanics, if you check the politics tab of your country you'll see we added all kinds of new slots and other bits. This is the foundation of our new political system, which will be expanded in the future.\n Keep in mind that your stability level is directly influenced by your Political Power balance (Positive PP = GOOD, negative PP = BAD), so keep an eye on that. You should also keep in mind that the mod is designed with the assumption that the players will always annex all possible states in peace treaties, so you should make sure to do that~!\n  Finally, we'd like  to remind you this is still a very early alpha, so expect bugs, crashes and various headaches in this version, and if you encounter any of these, please report them on the Kaiserreich forums, our public discord channel, or on our section of the PDX forums. Have fun!"
 kr.political.24.a:0 "Thank you Kaiserreich team!"

 kr.political.25.a:0 "Great job, lads!"
 
 kr.political.26.t:0 "Special Thanks"
 kr.political.26.d:0 "Special thanks go to our past developers in the HOI2 and DH versions, Sarmatia1871 who created this marvellous universe, and of course the fans, who stuck with us for over 10 years. We could not have gotten here without you guys. Thank you for playing Kaiserreich!"
 kr.political.26.a:0 "On the shoulders of giants!"
 
 kr.political.27.t:0 "The Stability System"
 kr.political.27.d:0 "Kaiserreich for HOI4 introduces a new mechanic : the Stability system. Stability is present in the form of laws which you can see in your political screen next to the trade laws. These are influenced by your political power. Having under -60PP will make you a potential target to get at low stability, -200 will get you to very low stability and -500 will get you in a disaster; you want to avoid that, trust me. On the contrary you'll be able to go up to very low stability if you're above -400, to low stability if you're above -100 and to average stability if you're above 0. \n The mechanic to go up to good and very good stability is a bit different, you have to get 150PP and then you'll be eligible for an event asking you if you want to go up in stability and spend those 150 points or not. You'll then lose the positive stability levels if you happen to get under 0PP. \n Please keep in mind that the events adding or removing you stability don't instantly fire and can take up to 45, 90, 110 or even 200 days to fire if you're lucky so you should try to get that PP up again as quickly as possible. Finally if you happen to forget what you read here you'll be able to see the requirements for each level as tooltips if you hover over the stability ideas in the law screen, but there is no reason that you would forget right ?"
 kr.political.27.a:0 "Thanks for clicking, now that PP is for us!"
