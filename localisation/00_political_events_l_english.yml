 kr.political.24.t:0 "Kaiserreich Alpha 0.1"
 kr.political.24.d:0 "The Kaiserreich team proudly presents the alpha 0.1 of our Kaiserreich HOI4 project.\n For months, our team has worked in every corner of the world to bring you the product you are playing, we hope you will enjoy it as much as we do.\n First off there are several things we'd like to point out regarding our new mechanics, if you check the politics tab of your country you'll see we added all kinds of new slots and other bits, this is the foundation of our new political system which will be expanded in the future.\n Keep in mind that your stability level is directly influenced by your Political Power balance (Positive PP = GOOD, negative PP = BAD ) so keep an eye on that. You should also keep in mind that the mod is designed with the assumption that the players will always annex all possible states in peace treaties, so you should make sure to do that~!\n  Finally, we'd like  to remind you this is still a very early alpha, so expect bugs, crashes and various headaches in this version, if you encounter any of these, please report them on the Kaiserreich forums, our public discord channel or on our section of the PDX forums. Have fun! "
