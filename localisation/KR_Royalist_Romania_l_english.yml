romania.100.t:0 "Return of the King"
romania.100.d:0 "King Carol II of Romania has finally returned to his home country. After landing with a small plane the King was quickly driven to Iasi where a large crowd eagerly awaited his arrival. While elsewhere in the city police and army elements rounded up some fanatic Iron Guard members, in the centre people came together to celebrate this momentous occasion.\n\nAccompanying the King was his son, Michael, who nominally reigned from 1927 until being deposed by the Iron Guard. The former King has stated his unequivocal support for his father, stating that he is the right man to lead Romania in these difficult times.\n\nOver all this looms the threat of the imminent civil war, and already shots can be heard. Romania will go through some very dark times. But for now, we celebrate the return of the King!"
romania.100.a:0 "We will fight for you!"

romania.101.t:0 "The Front of National Resurrection"
romania.101.d:0 "Quickly after loyal officers seized parts of Romania talks begun between different groups keen on defeating the Iron Guard. This has resulted in a wartime coalition of democratic parties, businessmen and the army, called the Front of National Resurrection (FRN). Different democratic parties, persecuted under the autocratic regime, have been re-established in Iasi. Some important businessmen have pledged their loyalty to the King and denounced the Guard. A temporary military government will govern the country until the Iron Guard has been defeated."
romania.101.a:0 "As long as we fight together..."
