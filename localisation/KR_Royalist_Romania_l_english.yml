royalist.64.t:0 "The oil of Ploesti"
royalist.64.d:0 "After Romania's defeat in the Weltkrieg, we were promised control over the rich oilfields of Ploesti. The former leader of Romania, Codreanu, nationalised the oilfields a few years ago with much fanfare, yet even he didn't dare stop the oil shipments. Now with the monarchists back in power it is time to remind them to honour their commitments."
royalist.64.a:0 "Remind the Romanians to ship their oil."

royalist.65.t:0 "The Germans demand their oil shipments"
royalist.65.d:0 "After our defeat in the Weltkrieg, we were forced to cede control over the rich oilfields of Ploesti to Germany. The former leader, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, nationalised the oilfields a few years ago, yet continued the oil shipments. Now that we have won the civil war, the Germans want us to continue the shipments."
royalist.65.a:0 "We will keep sending the oil, for now."
royalist.65.b:0 "Refuse outright!"

royalist.66.t:0 "[From.GetName] continues their oil shipments"

royalist.66.a:0 "Great!"

royalist.67.t:0 "[From.GetName] refuses to renew their oil shipments"
royalist.67.d:0 "The Romanians refused our rightful demand to renew the oil shipments to us. What shall we do?"

royalist.67.b:0 "War will solve this!"

royalist.68.t:0 "The Military Provisional government and the approaching election"
royalist.68.d:0 "The time has come to begin the preparations for the first free general election after the civil war. However, some have suggested that perhaps it would be better if the election was postponed and the military remained in control of the country, in the interest of stability of course."
royalist.68.a:0 "Continue with the preparations for the election."
royalist.68.b:0 "Cancel the election and make the military government permanent."

royalist.69.t:0 "First free elections"
royalist.69.d:0 "After several months of preparations, the provisional government has completed the arrangements for the first free election in the Kingdom of Romania since the civil war. There are 300 seats available in the national assembly and various political parties have begun their campaigns. But currently only three parties have a chance of gaining a majority and thus forming a new government. Which one shall prevail?"
royalist.69.a:0 "National Renaissance Front wins elections."
royalist.69.b:0 "Social Democratic Party wins elections."
royalist.69.c:0 "National Liberal Party wins elections."
royalist.69.e:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy."

royalist.70.t:0 "The end of oil shipments from Romania!"
royalist.70.d:0 "Alarming news has just reached Berlin from our ambassadors in Bucharest. The Romanian oil fields are no longer available meaning that we no longer posses a steady supply of oil. Oil is one of the, if not the most, most vital resources to the German economy. If we do not remedy this situation quick, we could see a decline in industrial output and other nations within Europe may perceive us as weak for being unable to secure what is rightfully ours."
royalist.70.a:0 "Verdammt!"
