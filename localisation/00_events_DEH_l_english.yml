 delhi.1.t:0 "Remnants of the Raj"
 delhi.1.d:0 "When the Weltkrieg began, no place under the sun of the British empire responded more loyally than India. 'The swords of the martial princes leapt from their scabbards', as one reporter put it. From the trenches of the Western Front to the deserts of Arabia, the troops of the British Raj fought doggedly for its King-Emperor and the glory of battle. However, it was also the expectation of the nascent Indian national movement that their full support for the war effort would in turn translate into political reforms at home, once the war had been concluded. As the Kaiserschlacht concluded, the battles on the Western Front victoriously for the Central Powers, and the campaign in the Middle East turned into a stalemate, Britain and her empire accepted Ludendorff's Peace With Honour in 1921. The defeat did not deter the Indian reform movement, who now loudly demanded Home-Rule to be put in effect. The British response, galvanized by the loss in the Weltkrieg, was draconian. As the British reneged on their promises, the Indian National Congress became further radicalized and sabotage and terror soon became an all too common sight throughout the Raj. When the murder of 41 striking miners in Wales cast the Home Isles into the currents of Revolution, India soon followed suit. Desperately trying to maintain some influence on the sub-continent, the exiled Royalist government in Canada decided to grant India Home-Rule as a Dominion within the Empire under the leadership of Maharaja Ganga Singh of Bikaner. This however did little to calm the resurgent independence movement, and thus when the first elections were held the INC boycotted the ballots. This in turn brought a broad coalition of loyalist parties to power in Delhi which held little legitimacy in Bombay and the Bengal, both centres of nationalist and socialist sentiment. The result was a bloody civil war when the INC declared their own provisional government in Calcutta, soon followed by a cabale of southern nationalist princes united behind the Nizam of Hyderabad. Despite early setbacks, such as an invasion by the Afghans that saw Quetta and Peshawar ceded to Kabul, and defeat in battle, Ganga Singh managed to rally the loyalist forces and defeat the aspirations of both Calcutta and Hyderabad, declaring himself governor-general for life in the process."
 delhi.1.a:0 "Long Live H.R.H George V! Long Live the Maharaja!"
 
 delhi.2.t:0 "1936: Delhi's Darkest Hour"
 delhi.2.d:0 "The Delhi government is the self-proclaimed legal successor state to the British Raj, yet within its borders different fractions vie for power. The progressive rajas and bourgeoisie are content with authoritarian dominion status, but radical nationalists and independence activists are still calling for the expulsion of the British. Tensions are running high inside the Red Fort as well as in the nation's central parliament. To the North, the Afghans watch our every move, while the decadent Southern Princes in their so-called 'Federation' plot our downfall. To the East, the Syndicalist scum of the Bharatya Commune may well succumb to totalism, posing another huge threat for our nation. Reform is necessary, otherwise, we will be wiped off the face of the planet, and the British will have failed to rule India just like Alexander, the Mughals, and all others that have come before them.  NOTE: DO NOT DELETE DIVISION TEMPLATES: They are required for certain events to function properly!!!"
 delhi.2.a:0 "Have faith in the Maharaja and the King-Emperor!"
 
 delhi.3.t:0 "The Death of King George V"
 delhi.3.d:0 "The ousted king of Britain, George V, finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since the Revolution swept through the home isles. As the head of state of the Dominion of India, Delhi, his death will certainly cause trouble amongst the competing fractions of the former Raj, but for now the Chamber of Princes will head a regency until the coronation of his son, Edward."
 delhi.3.a:0 "The Empire enters a state of mourning."
 
 delhi.4.t:0 "Afghanistan Invades!"
 delhi.4.d:0 "Sensing a moment of weakness following the death of George V, Afghanistan has invaded! This is not the first time they have done this, as following the Weltkrieg, they attacked and stole the cities of Peshwar and Quetta. We must protect the Dominion! Jai Hind!"
 delhi.4.a:0 "We will drive back these dogs and reclaim our lands!"

 afg.0.t:0 "The 5th Anglo-Afghan War?"
 afg.0.d:0 "In the remnants of the Raj to our south, dissent has sprung up like wildflowers in the wake of Edward VIII's succession. In Kabul, we have our own troubles keeping the latent discontent of reform down. A repeat of the victorius Fourth Anglo-Afghan War might cement our own position whilst winning new lands and subjects for the crown!"
 afg.0.a:0 "The time is ripe! Let us repeat our victories!"
 afg.0.b:0 "What does India have but cows?"
 
 delhi.5.t:0 "The 5th Anglo-Afghan War: Victory!"
 delhi.5.d:0 "Amanullah Khan's ambition of furthering Afghan influence in India has been crushed. The troops of the Dominion have crossed the Durrand Line, retaken the lost North-West Frontier Provinces and the cities of Peshawar and Quetta, whilst threatening Kabul itself. The Afghan state is in complete disarray and her populace begging for peace. We should at least take back our core provinces, but any further military actions would be politically costly. Setting up a puppet government would work as well, but that would require just as much political capital."
 delhi.5.a:0 "We should push no further, after all, Afghanistan is the 'Graveyard of Empires'..."
 delhi.5.b:0 "We should set up a puppet government, to ensure the loyalty of the Afghans."
 delhi.5.c:0 "We must try to pacify the Afghans! When has that ever failed? Onwards to Kabul!"

 delhi.6.t:0 "Who shall rule Afghanistan?"
 delhi.6.d:0 "Now that Afghanistan is firmly within our sphere of influence, we must decide who its ruler will be."
 delhi.6.a:0 "Let Amanullah Khan keep the throne, the people like him."
 delhi.6.b:0 "Install Mohmamed Nadir Shah, he will be loyal to us."
 
 delhi.7.t:0 "The Imperial Durbar of 1936"
 delhi.7.d:0 "Last held in 1911 in honour of the late George V, the Imperial Durbar was a mass event celebrating the coronation of a new British monarch, as well as a moment for important proclamations regarding the state. Now, with Afghanistan defeated by Indians and the British Empire still in danger, many expect the new monarch, Edward, to have his powers further weakened by an empowered legislature. However, he is still seen as a uniting entity among the disparate ethnic, cultural, and religious groups that make up the subcontinent."
 delhi.7.a:0 "Hail Edward VIII, King-Emperor of India!"
 delhi.7.b:0 "Hail Edward VIII, and his Viceroy of India, Maharaja Ganga Singh!"

 delhi.8.t:0 "1936 Dominion Elections"
 delhi.8.d:0 "Now that Afghanistan has been dealt with, and the country secured, King Edward has decided to hold elections. Four major parties are competing for the people's votes. The Indian Liberal Party, under V. S. Srinivvasa Sastri, the socially liberal Swaraj Party under Narasimha Kelkar, the socially democratic All-India Home Rule Party under Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and finally the more conservative Unionist party under Sikander Hayat Khan."
 delhi.8.a:0 "The Indian Liberal Party Wins!"

 delhi.10.t:0 "Status of the Diarchy"
 delhi.10.d:0 "Delhi is a mixture of colonial government and semi-independant princely states. The new government has announced a plan today to try and rectify these differnces."
 delhi.10.a:0 "Keep the Status Quo!"
 delhi.10.b:0 "Let the princes have nominal power, but give them a pension!"
 delhi.10.c:0 "Get rid of the princes! We are a modern state!"
 
 delhi.11.t:0 "The Indian Economy Act"
 delhi.11.d:0 "The new government has decided to draft a major industrial reform bill. We can try to shift more of our power towards military production, but this will be costly, and keeping the status quo will earn us loyalty among industrial barons like J. R. D. Tata."
 delhi.11.a:0 "Keep a free market system. It has served us well."
 delhi.11.b:0 "We should have a balanced system."
 delhi.11.c:0 "Enforce a single market for a single nation!"

 delhi.12.t:0 "Status of Trade Unions in Delhi"
 delhi.12.d:0 "Trade unions, while not as prevalant as in Europe, have long had a history in India. With the new threat of Syndicalism, however, the government has been forced to take a stand on them."
 delhi.12.a:0 "Ban the Unions! The workers can fend for themselves!"

 delhi.12.c:0 "The government will support the trade unions!"

 delhi.13.t:0 "The Bombay Plan"

 delhi.13.a:0 "Have a series of 5 year plans dictate the economy!"
 delhi.13.b:0 "Enact a balanced system where the government can intervene if necessary!"
 delhi.13.c:0 "A free market for a free people!"

 delhi.100.t:0 "The Question of the Princely Armies"
 delhi.100.d:0 "The Maharajas and petty princes of Delhi each have armies of their own. While nominally under control of the Delhi government, they are not connected in any way to the chain of command. The government has been called upon to provide a solution."
 delhi.100.a:0 "Completly integrate the princely troops into the army!"
 delhi.100.b:0 "Formally integrate the Princely armies into the army, but let the princes remain in control of their divisions!"
 delhi.100.c:0 "Maintain the status quo. We don't want to rock the boat now..."
 
 delhi.101.t:0 "Atrocities in Nepal!"
 delhi.101.d:0 "The Indian minority in Nepal have started riots against the Nepalese throughout the Ganges-Yamuna Basin, with insurgents taking up arms in Dehradun and Gorakhpur. Caused by the recent massacre committed by the Royal Nepalese Army on Indian protesters celebrating the Hindu festival Diwali, their protests are rapidly spiraling into violence. The Indian minority in Nepal demand the government's intervention!"
 delhi.101.a:0 "To war! We must liberate the oppressed!"
