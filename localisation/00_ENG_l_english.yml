 ENG_tuc:0 "The Congress of the Trade Unions"
 ENG_tuc_desc:0 "The 1936 TUC congress has opened with much fanfare. This is the most important political event of the year.  New ministers are appointed and (although it is not explicitly mentioned) changes in Union policy are made and announced. This years congress will probably be a bit special though. Long-time TUC chairman Philip Snowden has long indicated that he intends to resign following this congress and the stakes are high. Rivalling factions are forming behind the curtains and the decentralizationist Authonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralizationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley), status quo socialist Federationists (Arthur Horner) and radical egalitarian paci-isolationist Congregationists (Annie Kenney) are all vying for superiority in the TUC. Whatever the outcome this will surely be a night to remember... "  
 ENG_tuc_economy:0 "Economic Policy"
 ENG_tuc_economy_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions.

 ENG_tuc_internal:0 "Internal Policy"
 ENG_tuc_internal_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."

 ENG_tuc_foreign:0 "Foreign Policy"
 ENG_tuc_foreign_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions.

 ENG_synthetic_industry:0 "Synthetic Industry"
 ENG_synthetic_industry_desc:0 "For the longest time, the British industry was dependent on imports from the colonies, and the economic impact of being cut off from these supplies is still very much felt.

 ENG_dissolve_tuc:0 "Dissolve the TUC"
 ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union Congress has served its part. By now, it has changed from a symbol of the Syndicalist dream to a symbol of Centralist repression.

 uob.1.t:0 "Vote for economic policy"

 uob.2.b:0 "Fed.: The current system is satisfactory"
 uob.2.c:0 "Aut.: Decentralization - perhaps even local TUC's for the Home Nations"
 uob.3.t:0 "Defecting Officers"
 uob.3.d:0 "In light of the recent demonstration of political freedom on our Island some Royalist officers have defected to us - namely Adm. Willis, Gen. Hutton and Weltkrieg Hero Gen. Alexander. They could help the Republican Army and Navy with their expertise. However, while we don't have any proof there is suspicion that some of them may have fought against the Workers in the Second Glorious Revolution."

 uob.4.t:0 "Vote for military policy"

 uob.6.t:0 "The Resignation of Philip Snowden"
 uob.6.d:0 "On the last day of the TUC congress Chairman Philip Snowden climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicans do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall. The country is shocked and in a few days' time the TUC will have to vote on a new chairman."
 uob.6.a:0 "Shocking, to say the least"
 uob.7.t:0 "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure a Majority"
 uob.7.d:0 "The TUC has decided to vote for Oswald Mosley's Maximists with an overwhelming majority. Oswald Mosley will become the new Chairman of the TUC."

 uob.14.ac:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Kenney"
 uob.14.ad:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Horner"
 uob.15.t:0 "Show of Force"
 uob.15.d:0 "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval maneuver near Ireland or even further westwards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organize countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commisar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
 uob.15.a:0 "Keep the fleet in our territorial waters"
 uob.15.b:0 "Send the Grand Fleet towards Ireland"
 uob.15.c:0 "Divide the fleet and perform manoeuvres near the Azores and Iceland"
 uob.16.t:0 "British Fleet Manoeuvres"
 uob.16.d:0 "The British navy has steamed out of its ports and has assembled to demonstrate its power against our neutral island. In face of this grave situation many politicians suggest that Ireland should find someone to guarantee its independence. The most reasonable option would be Germany - but there are even some advocating a return to Windsor protection."
 uob.16.a:0 "Maintain our neutrality"
 uob.16.b:0 "Ask the Kaiser for protection"
 uob.16.c:0 "Ask the Canadian king for protection"
 uob.17.t:0 "Ireland asks for help"
 uob.17.d:0 "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violations of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
 uob.17.a:0 "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Entente"
 uob.17.b:0 "Annouce our support for Ireland"
 uob.17.c:0 "We are not ready for such involvement in the Old World"
 uob.18.t:0 "Canada protects Ireland"
 uob.18.d:0 "The Canadian government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Windsor influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
 uob.18.a:0 "Most splendid!"
 uob.18.b:0 "Bloody hell!"
 uob.19.t:0 "Canada supports Ireland"
 uob.19.d:0 "The Canadian government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Canadians are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict. Still, Britain is widely expected to ease their policy towards Ireland until the diplomatic climate changes."
 uob.19.a:0 "At least we're not alone..."
 uob.19.b:0 "It may actually be quite wise to do so..."
 uob.20.t:0 "Canada abandons Ireland"
 uob.20.d:0 "The Canadian government has ignored the Irish call for help. Whatever comes next they must be prepared for the worst as this gives the British a free hand in choosing their next step towards the Emerald Isle."
 uob.20.a:0 "Oh no!"
 uob.20.b:0 "Rule Britannia!"
 uob.21.t:0 "Ireland asks for help"
 uob.21.d:0 "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violation of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
 uob.21.a:0 "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by Mitteleuropa"
 uob.21.b:0 "Annouce our support for Ireland"
 uob.21.c:0 "We are not ready for such involvement"
 uob.22.t:0 "Germany protects Ireland"
 uob.22.d:0 "The German government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Hohenzollern influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
 uob.22.a:0 "Most splendid!"
 uob.22.b:0 "Bloody hell!"
 uob.23.t:0 "Germany supports Ireland"
 uob.23.d:0 "The German government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Germans are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict.

 uob.24.a:0 "Oh no!"
 uob.24.b:0 "Rule Britannia!"
 uob.25.t:0 "Union of Britain threatens Iceland and the Azores"

 uobflavour.41.d:0 "Mussolini, Valois, Beria and other interested parties arrived in Birmingham today to discuss their common ground. It has been agreed that Maximism, Sorelianism and National-Syndicalism all share basic principles of the state's primacy in the socialist struggle, the role of national identity within the state and the importance of a strong central authority to preserve and build socialism. The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism. These statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name "Totalism" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosely who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism. All present  politicians and philosophers have signed the manifesto entitled 'The Totalist Charter', available in all appropriate languages."

 ENG_horner_desc:0 "Arthur Horner was born in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, the eldest surviving son of a family of seventeen children only six of whom lived past infancy. Horner's father was a chargehand porter in the railway goods station. His maternal grandfather and two maternal uncles were miners. His earliest employment was as a grocer’s assistant and delivery boy in the coalfield communities around Merthyr. After a short spell in Merthyr railway goods station he was drawn into coalmining employment in 1915 due to his growing interest in the political radicalism of trade union activists in the nearby Rhondda coalfield. \n Horner's first political affiliation was socialist and Keir Hardie, who had been elected MP for Merthyr Tydfil in 1900, his first political hero. After he had joined the Independent Labour Party in Merthyr, Horner moved to the colliery village of Ynyshir in the Rhondda where he became a protégé of Noah Ablett, trade union militant, executive member of the South Wales Miners Federation and also convenor of local classes in Marxist education which Horner attended. During this period Horner gradually relinquished the strong Christian faith of his teenage years during which he had been baptised into the Churches of Christ. This small but intellectually inclined Protestant sect, had recognised his potential talent as a preacher and financed a period of training for him as a lay evangelist from which he gained considerable confidence in public speaking and debate. \n Opposing the Weltkrieg from the standpoint of class solidarity, in 1917 he fled to Dublin to avoid arrest for ignoring his call-up papers. Horner was a supporter of demands for Irish home-rule and became involved with the rebel factions from the 1916 Easter Rising, joining the Irish Citizen Army. On his return to Britain he was arrested by the authorities for avoiding conscription and sentenced to six months hard labour at Wormwood Scrubs. After he had served his sentence he was refused the amnesty made available after the war to most conscientious objectors, rearrested and sent to Camarthen jail. The SWMF campaigned for his release and to this end secured his election in absentia as checkweighman at Mardy Colliery, one of the most militant collieries in the Rhondda valleys. To add to the pressure on the authorities Horner began a hunger strike, refusing both food and water. After six days this combination of tactics secured his release in May 1919. Horner then went on to play an active role in the 1925 British Revolution."
