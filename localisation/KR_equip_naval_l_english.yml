 U-boat_pre_desc:0 "The first U-boats opened a new horizon for naval warfare. These new vessels can break through enemy waters without being detected and wreak havoc on the convoy routes."
 destroyer_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Destroyer"
 destroyer_pre_desc:0 "Before the Weltkrieg these destroyers were used to protect capital ships from torpedo boats. Some of them were equipped with torpedoes themselves."

 light_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "Protected Cruisers were used to protect trade routes and scout enemy waters. Some of them were equipped with torpedoes effectively making them to torpedo cruisers."
 heavy_cruiser_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Heavy Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The armoured cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered."
 battle_cruiser_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Battle Cruiser"
 battle_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships."
 battleship_pre:0 "Pre-Weltkrieg Battleship"
 battleship_pre_desc:0 "Considered by some to be a relic of a bygone era of naval warfare, by others as the most impressive ships ever built, no one can deny that these remnants of the battleship arms race constitute some of the most heavily armed and armoured vessels ever built."

#### JAP - JAPAN ####
 JAP_submarine_pre:1 "Kaichu Class"
 JAP_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The Kaichu class U-boats were built after WWI and based on the earlier U-boats. These medium-sized U-boats were adequately armed, possesses good operational range and had good speed for their time, but by 1938 they were somewhat outdated. Altogether 42 Kaichu type U-boats were built for the IJN and the series included 7 variants."
 JAP_submarine_1:1 "Kaidai III Class"
 JAP_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Kaidai type U-boat (Kaidai-gata sensuikan) was a type of 1st class U-boat operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) before and during World War II. The type name, was shortened to Kaigun-shiki Ōgata Sensuikan. The nine Kaidai IIIs were based on earlier designs, but featured a strengthened hull. The "IIIb" types were 40 cm longer and had a different bow design. All nine boats were constructed between 1927 and 1930."
 JAP_destroyer_pre:1 "Momi Class"
 JAP_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Momi class was a development of the Enoki second-class destroyers, relying on the same basic hull. They were quite small, comparable to Royal Navy corvettes. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers captured during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."
 JAP_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Suma Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "While more lightly armed and armoured than many of its contemporaries, their small size and relatively simple design facilitated their construction and their relatively high speed made them useful for many military operations. Both participated in combat during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Izumo Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Izumo-class cruisers were a pair of armoured cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the vessels were built in Britain. They were part of the 'Six-Six Fleet' expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05—the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima—but played a much more minor role in World War I."
 JAP_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Tsukuba Class"
 JAP_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Tsukuba-class cruisers were a pair of large armoured cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the first decade of the 20th century. Construction began during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and their design was influenced by the IJN's experiences during the war. The British development of the battlecruiser the year after Tsukuba was completed made her and her sister ship Ikoma obsolete, as they were slower and more weakly armed than the British, and later German, ships. Despite this, they were reclassified in 1912 as battlecruisers by the IJN."
 JAP_battleship_pre:1 "Fuso Class"
 JAP_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernised in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armoured and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centreline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry." 
 JAP_battleship_1:1 "Nagato Class"
 JAP_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Nagato-class battleships were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War I, although they were not completed until after the end of the war. Nagato, the lead ship of the class, frequently served as a flagship. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. They were modernised in 1933–36 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style."
 JAP_carrier_pre:1 "Hosho Class"
 JAP_carrier_pre_desc:1 "Hōshō, literally 'phoenix in flight' was the world's first commissioned ship that was designed and built as an aircraft carrier, and the first aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. Hōshō's superstructure and other obstructions to the flight deck were removed in 1924 on the advice of experienced aircrews."
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:1 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was one of Japan's first fleet carriers. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armoured carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."

### RUS - Russia ###

RUS_destroyer_pre:0 "Novik Class"
RUS_destroyer_1:0 "Orfey Class"
RUS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey-class destroyers are an improved version of the previous Novik class. They feature a decent surface and AA armament for their size, a somewhat short range, but a good speed and a heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes are further improved versions of this class with an increased main armament and hull size."
RUS_destroyer_2:0 "Gnevny Class"
RUS_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny-class destroyers are an important part of the 1934-1937 shipbuilding program. The class itself is heavily influenced by the latest foreign projects and considered a successful design. Their weight is in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they are well-armed and have a decent AA and torpedo armament. Due to their powerful engines, they are fast but somewhat short-ranged vessels."
RUS_destroyer_3:0 "Soobrazitelnyi Class"
RUS_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi-class destroyers are an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines are redesigned and they have a stronger AA armament. They weigh between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range are similar to the Gnevny class."
RUS_destroyer_4:0 "Skoryi Class"
RUS_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class is a further improvement on the Soobrazitelnyi class. The increase in size and weight (2,500-3,100 tons) results in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships are built as a modular design that results in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament is the same as that of the previous Soobrazitelnyi class, but the main guns are housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."

RUS_light_cruiser_1:0 "Svetlana Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Svetlana-class cruiser, had her construction started before Second Patriotic war but the war defeat and the following revolution and civil war delayed the completion of the entire class. In the late 1920's, she was finally commissioned for the Russian Navy along with her half-sister Rurik. Those vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Russian Navy. They are heavily armed and well-armoured cruisers for ships of their time."
RUS_light_cruiser_2:0 "Ruslan Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Ruslan-class light cruisers are a series of vessels, which are somewhat of a mix of older and more recent technologies. Using hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes as a base for the new project, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer calibre guns and a decent AA armament they are suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities with the Oleg class cruisers."
RUS_light_cruiser_3:0 "Kazarsky Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Kazarsky-class cruisers are based on the Oleg class cruisers and are included in the 1937-1943 shipbuilding program. As the first true modern light cruiser of the Russian navy, they carry a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with a decent torpedo armament. Overall, those are good ships with a thick armour, high speed, a good operational range, and a weight between 10,500 and 14,000 tons."
RUS_light_cruiser_4:0 "Slava Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Slava-class cruisers are the most numerous cruisers of the Russian Navy and are improved versions of the preceding Kazarsky class. Compared to the Kazarsky's, they have the same armament, machinery and armour, but have an increased fuel capacity allowing for a bigger range, improved U-boat protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and a slightly better manoeuvrability. They are designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts."

RUS_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Rurik Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Rurik, originally the Admiral Nakhimov-class light cruiser, is the half-sister of the Svetlana-class. Rurik was completed with a modified design that included larger-caliber 180mm guns and stronger AA armament. Because it is a rebuilt light cruiser, it's armor is thinner compared to the heavy cruisers of other navies."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Oleg Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Oleg-class cruisers are the Russian Navy's first modern heavy cruisers. The design is based on the cancelled Interbellum Russian cruiser projects and is built as part of the 1937-1943 shipbuilding program. The ships are displaced between 7,700 and 9,200 tons. They are armed with new 180mm guns in 3 triple turrets and a solid AA battery. Their strong engines provide good speed and an acceptable operational range, while the armor belt is thin compared to other heavy cruisers."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Alexandr Nevskyi Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Alexandr Nevskyi-class heavy cruisers were designed in the late 1930's-early 1940's to counter similar vessels in neighboring countries. The design called for a larger-sized vessel displacing between 15,500 and 17,000 tons. They are equipped with four triple 240mm cannons to fight off enemy cruisers, a heavy AA armament for self-defense, and a larger scout plane force to find the enemy. Their main tasks are scouting for enemy forces and convoy hunting."
RUS_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Dmytryi Donskoi Class"
RUS_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Dmytryi Donskoy-class heavy cruisers are the development of the previous Alexandr Nevskyi class. Design studies started in 1943 and the final version emerged in 1945. The vessels feature 220mm cannons in 3 triple turrets and a strong AA armament. Displacement is at least 26,500 tons."

RUS_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Borodino Class"
RUS_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Borodino-class battlecruisers were class of four vessels authorized in 1914, just before Second Patriotic war. They were based on the Imperatritsa Mariya class battleships. They followed the contemporary Russian capital ship building practices of using four triple turrets to house the heavy main armament, strong secondary armament in casemates, and an overall flush-deck. They had a low profile with low draught to fight in the shallow waters of the Baltic Sea. Like many Russian ships of this period, the outbreak of Second Patriotic war and the Russian Revolution delayed these ships from ever being finished."
RUS_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Poltava Class"
RUS_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Poltava-class battlecruisers are authorized in the 1937-43 shipbuilding program and scheduled to be finished in the 1940's. The original design aimed for a large-sized modern heavy cruiser of 23,000 tons, but after information on the latest foreign battlecruiser vessels had arrived, the ships were redesigned to displace to 35,000 tons."

RUS_battleship_1:0 "Sevastopol Class"
RUS_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Sevastopol-class battleships were Second Patriotic war-era battleships and the first Dreadnoughts to serve in the Imperial Russian Navy. Their design and turret layout served as the basis of all the succeeding battleship and battlecruiser classes. Only three ships survived the chaos of the Russian Revolution. They were modernized and refitted during the 1930's, resulting in a tall almost pagoda-like superstructure. They have modern electronics and a strong AA complement."
RUS_battleship_2:0 "Vladivostok Class"
RUS_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Vladivostok-class battleships are designed in the late 1930's to be part of Russian Ocean-Going Navy. The ships displace around 41,000 tons, are armed with nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets, and a secondary armament of twelve 152mm guns. Its good AA armament and thick armor provide a strong defense against air and surface targets. The project elements are used in the Vladimir Monomakh-class battleships."
RUS_battleship_3:0 "Petrograd Class"
RUS_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Petrograd-class battleship is a design to match and counter any existing foreign battleships of any potential opponent country. Its nine 406mm cannons in 3 triple turrets are designed to provide adequate firepower, while its 130mm AA guns, thick armor, and large engines can ensure its survival in battle."
RUS_battleship_4:0 "Moskva Class"
RUS_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Moskva-class battleships are intended to provide the Russian Navy with its primary firepower in the new era of naval warfare. They are fast, well-armed, and well-armored vessels, which have taken all the best from previous Russian battleship projects. There are projects to equip battleships of that class with R-2 series ballistic missiles."

RUS_SH_battleship_1:0 "Vladimir Monomakh"
RUS_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Vladimir Monomakh-class is authorized in the 1937-43 shipbuilding program for the rebuilding Russian Navy. The ships are planned with a standard displacement of 59,000 tons, three triple turrets carrying 406mm cannons, and a heavy secondary and AA armament. They also have strong engines to accommodate their very thick belt armor."
RUS_SH_battleship_2:0 "Ivan Groznyi"
RUS_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Ivan Groznyi-class battleships are a modified and improved version of the previous Vladimir Monomakh-class. Compared to their predecessors, they carry four triple turrets of the same 406mm caliber cannons, thickened belt armor, a revised layout of secondary guns, and stronger AA armament to counter the increased threat from the carrier-based planes."

RUS_carrier_1:0 "Ismail Class"
RUS_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Ismail-class aircraft carrier is the direct conversion of the unfinished hull of her Borodino-class battlecruiser namesake. Due to the nature of conversion, the ship has a thick armor belt and strong anti-surface and AA armament for her time. A moderately-sized air group provides her fleet the necessary air cover. The project was not carried out until late 1930-s due to costs and the state of the Russian shipbuilding industry after the revolution and civil war."
RUS_carrier_2:0 "Azov Class"
RUS_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Azov-class aircraft carrier is a design to provide the Russian Navy air projection over its fleets. They are similar in size to the contemporary foreign classes but carry additional secondary guns against surface targets and adequate AA guns for air cover. The increased armor results in a slightly reduced air group compared to foreign counterparts."
RUS_carrier_3:0 "Narva Class"
RUS_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Narva-class carriers are designed in the late 1930's-early 1940's. They are planned to provide air cover for the new surface fleets ordered in the plan of Russian Ocean-Going Navy. The ships are planned to displace around 30,000 tons, have strong AA armament, good armor, and an adequate air group."
RUS_carrier_4:0 "Kronstadt Class"
RUS_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Kronstadt-class aircraft carriers are the improved versions of the previous Narva-class ships. Design studies finished in the 1945 resulting in a larger ship with thinner armor. The extra space is used to install stronger AA armament and provide for the ability to carry a larger air group."

RUS_submarine_1:0 "AG Class"
RUS_submarine_1_desc:0 "Amerikansky Golland (American Holland) class submarines were built in Canada, then delivered to Russia during Second Patriotic war, where they were finally assembled. They were the direct copy of the successful Holland type submarines. They were designed to be good sea boats well-armed for their time."
RUS_submarine_2:0 "Series V Shuka"
RUS_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Series V submarines of the Schuka class are the second-most numerous submarines of the Russian Navy. Their large number come from their deployment to the four fleets of the Russian state: Black Sea, Baltic, Northern and Pacific. They are medium-sized patrol submarines with good torpedo armament and seaworthiness."
RUS_submarine_3:0 "Series XIV Delfin"
RUS_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Series XIV submarines are large cruising submarines of the Russian Navy with extended range. They are essentially an improved version of the Series IV Pravda class. These submarines feature heavy armament of both surface guns and torpedoes. They have a long range but only satisfactory seaworthiness."
RUS_submarine_4:0 "Series XXV Kosatka"
RUS_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Series XXV submarines, are the development of the previous cruising submarines projects, created for Russian Navy. Their design is heavily influenced by the German Type XXI submarines, and they are meant to replace the older Series XIV boats. They are large, ocean-going submarines with a heavy torpedo armament and long range."

### OTT – Ottoman Empire ###

OTT_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Yavuz Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Yavuz-class is a licenced copy of the German Moltke-class battlecruisers. During the Weltkrieg, the Moltke-class SMS Goeben was transferred to the Ottoman Navy and renamed the Yavuz Sultan Selim, effectively founding the class. After the war, the Ottomans purchased a licence to produce additional Yavuz-class battlecruisers.

OTT_battle_cruiser_1:1 "Fatih Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Fatih-class is a fairly typical battlecruiser of the post-Weltkrieg era. It is heavily based on the preceding Yavuz-class, with the twin wing turrets replaced by a second super-firing front turret, allowing the same weight of fire in a broadside volley while saving significant weight."
 
OTT_battle_cruiser_2:1 "Kanuni Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Kanuni-class was designed with economy in mind, given the Empire's increasing economic difficulties. Wherever possible, non-critical elements were to be made from cheaper materials, and many crew conveniences were reduced or deleted. Nonetheless, the combat capabilities of the Kanuni-class were not skimped on, and it is easily in the same league as modern battlecruisers in foreign navies."

OTT_battle_cruiser_3:1 "Genç Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the sacrifices made in the design of the Kanuni-class led to widespread discontent and borderline mutiny among naval personnel, and the more frequent maintenance and replacement of substandard parts negated the initial cost savings, the Genç-class abandoned the idea of being as cheap as possible. It is an ambitious design that incorporates many examples of modern, cutting-edge technology, so despite having broadside volley firepower no better than the Kanuni- or Fatih-class designs, heavy-duty autoloaders grant it a reload rate almost on par with that of a heavy cruiser, granting it significant overall firepower."

OTT_battle_cruiser_4:1 "Yıldırım Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Yıldırım-class is in some ways more conservative than the preceding Genç. It abandons the 28cm guns used by all Turkish battlecruisers up to this point, even with the powerful, but temperamental autoloaders used on the Genç, in favour of significantly larger, battleship-grade models. Five double 40.6cm gun turrets do give it less overall firepower than modern battleships, and a lower rate of fire than with the smaller 28cm guns, but its high speed and manoeuvrability, and respectable belt armour, compensate for these shortcomings, making the Yildirim a fast, deadly warship."

OTT_battleship_pre:1 "Reşad Class"
OTT_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Reşad-class battleships were designed during the Weltkrieg, and have undergone significant modernisation since. They are heavily armed and armoured, with six twin 30cm centreline turrets giving a heavy broadside, and 16 150mm casemate guns providing close protection, but this design limited the available room for extra AA weaponry that could be added during refits."

OTT_battleship_1:1 "Vatan Class"
OTT_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Vatan-class battleships were a pair of ships designed during the later stages of the Weltkrieg. After the Treaty of Versailles, their construction was put on hold, and after the Peace with Honour both partially completed vessels were scrapped. Their design was quite modern for the era, with four twin 40.6cm turrets providing a heavy broadside volley, 12 150mm casemate-mounted secondary guns, and another 10 77mm open gun mounts, which could also be used against aircraft."

OTT_battleship_2:1 "Devlet Class"
OTT_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Devlet-class is an iteration on the Vatan-class design, longer and wider to accommodate a fifth double turret, and with a reduced secondary casemate armament in favour of dual-purpose guns and small-calibre anti-aircraft turrets."

OTT_battleship_3:1 "Padişah Class"
OTT_battleship_3_desc:1 "The Padişah-class is a very modern battleship design, with three triple centreline turrets allowing for similar firepower to the Devlet-class in a shorter, more compact ship. Extra attention was given to the armour scheme and the torpedo protection, offering this ship excellent survivability. The casemate secondaries have been eliminated entirely, replaced by a larger number of 88mm dual-purpose guns."

OTT_battleship_4:1 "Hakan Class"
OTT_battleship_4_desc:1 "After the shortcomings of the Padishah-class became clear, the Hakan-class was designed as a significantly longer ship, granting room to bring back the 150mm secondary guns, this time mounted in twin turrets, four to a side. The 88mm guns have received magazine feeding systems, and with eight single mountings and six triple turrets, all centrally guided by radar fire control, they can project a withering amount of defensive anti-air and anti-destroyer firepower."

OTT_SH_battleship_1:1 "Hümayun Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_1_desc:1 "Designed to take and deal heavy punishment, the Hümayun-class is an extravagantly expensive battleship design, boasting the thickest hull armour in the Ottoman Navy, and a deadly broadside from its four triple 40.6cm turrets. Despite its heavy close-range secondary armament, consisting of casemate-mounted guns, dual-purpose 88mm guns, and a blistering array of autocannons, the Hümayun still needs to be properly escorted, or aerial and U-boat threats will send her to the bottom."

OTT_SH_battleship_2:1 "Hanedan Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Hanedan-class is even larger and more powerful than the preceding Hümayun-class. She is a long, broad ship, barely able to pass through the Bosphorus, with a main armament of three triple 46cm gun turrets, two double 21cm secondary gun turrets, fourteen double 150mm dual-purpose turrets, and numerous magazine-fed single-mount and triple-turret 88mm guns, with one suite of radar fire control for the 46cm and 21cm guns and two additional ones for the smaller defensive armament. Despite all of this, her modern turbine engines make her faster than the Hümayun. As such, the papers have dubbed her the Sultan of the Seas."

OTT_carrier_pre:1 "Ertuğrul Class"
OTT_carrier_pre_desc:1 "After the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Navy recovered the wreckage of the British seaplane carrier HMS Ben-my-Chree, repaired and refitted her, and returned her to active duty in 1925. Her new name comes from the artillery officer, Mustafa Ertuğrul Pasha, whose battery sank her off at Kızılhisar. The recovered seaplanes, though too heavily damaged to be put back into service, and the aircraft handling mechanisms were studied particularly intently, both by the Ottoman Navy and the Air Force, providing a solid foundation on which to base further development of naval aviation."

OTT_carrier_1:1 "Ahmet Ali Class"
OTT_carrier_1_desc:1 "Named after the first black pilot in history, the naval aviator Izmirli Arap Ahmet Ali Pasha, this aircraft carrier design is the Ottoman Navy's effort to catch up with competing naval aviation efforts. It is armed with a 3cm Kuşçu AA gun, as well as several machine gun mounts, in order to defend itself against aerial threats."

OTT_carrier_2:1 "Valide Class"
OTT_carrier_2_desc:1 "The Valide-class is a much larger design than its predecessors, with larger hangar capacity and a longer runway. While it is still a conversion design, based on naval transport ships, its capabilities are broadly comparable to the older purpose-built carriers of other navies. It was initially designed with a large array of 3cm Kuşçu guns, but these outdated weapons have been scrapped in favour of several modern 88mm dual-purpose guns, capable of firing on nearby naval targets as well, and a number of more modern autocannon mounts. The engines of the transport ships converted to Valides are also replaced with modern steam turbine designs."

OTT_carrier_3:1 "Haseki Class"
OTT_carrier_3_desc:1 "The Haseki-class was originally planned as a seaplane carrier design; however, it quickly became clear that this type of ship is no longer suitable for main-line use in a modern navy. Instead, the Valide-class conversion design was used as a base for a new purpose-built aircraft carrier, longer and more well-armoured than its predecessor, armed with a respectable number of 88mm UçakSav guns, in addition to two experimental high-elevation dual-purpose 150mm gun mounts."

OTT_carrier_4:1 "Hatun Class"
OTT_carrier_4_desc:1 "The Hatun-class is the most advanced carrier ever designed for the Ottoman Navy. She is slightly longer than the Haseki-class, several metres taller, and almost twice as wide, giving her a significantly increased hangar capacity as well as a powerful armament suite of three twin dual-purpose 150mm gun turrets and six triple 88mm turrets. She also has provisions for installing the experimental Kulak radar array, which, when development is finished, will greatly increase her effective spotting range and gun direction."

OTT_submarine_pre:1 "Çanakkale Class"
OTT_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The first Çanakkale-class U-boats were built late during the Weltkrieg. These U-boats have very good torpedo armament for their time, but their slightly underpowered engines and thin hull make them vulnerable."

OTT_submarine_1:1 "Abdülhamit Class"
OTT_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Abdülhamit-class U-boats, named after sultan Abdülhamit II, are improved versions of the Çanakkale-class. This design was developed in the 1920s, fixing the problems that plagued its predecessor, while improving its attack capabilities with heavier, more modern torpedoes."

OTT_submarine_2:1 "Deniz Kızı Class"
OTT_submarine_2_desc:1 "The Deniz Kızı class breaks with the tradition of its predecessors by not focusing primarily on armament. It is a long, sleek design, with four frontal and two rear 533mm torpedo tubes, and a supercharged diesel engine that makes it one of the fastest U-boat designs in the world at the time of its design."

OTT_submarine_3:1 "Ay Class"
OTT_submarine_3_desc:1 "Largely an iteration on the preceding Deniz Kızı-class, the Ay-class is essentially a fatter version of the former, with thicker hull plating ensuring greater survivability, an extra two bow torpedo tubes, and a deck-mounted 88mm gun. Despite all this increased mass, the larger internal space allows for a larger engine too, which means it isn't any slower than its predecessor."

OTT_submarine_4:1 "Oruç Reis Class"
OTT_submarine_4_desc:1 "The Oruç Reis-class is a fairly unremarkable design overall. A further iteration of existing U-boat designs, improvements over the preceding Ay-class are mostly incremental. The addition of a more modern hydro-acoustic sonar system built under licence improves its ability to hunt other U-boats, at the cost of giving away its location to enemy U-boats and destroyers when in use. Besides this, the biggest change is the enlargement of the torpedo tubes from 533mm to 610mm."

OTT_destroyer_pre:1 "Konstantiniyye Class"
OTT_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Konstantiniyye-class was a development of the Osman II-class destroyers, relying on the same small basic hull. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers used during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."

OTT_destroyer_1:1 "Barbaros Class"
OTT_destroyer_1_desc:1 "The Barbaros-class is a fairly standard late Weltkrieg destroyer design, with a light armament of three 77mm guns, a twin 533mm torpedo tube mounted in the well deck, and two more mounted further back, on the ship's centreline. Powerful turbine engines give it a high top speed. However, as with all destroyers, its armour protection is practically nonexistent."

OTT_destroyer_2:1 "Saffet Class"
OTT_destroyer_2_desc:1 "Named after the captain of the torpedo boat that sank HMS Goliath during the Weltkrieg, the Saffet-class is designed as more of a gunboat, with two triple centreline 533mm torpedo tubes but four twin 77mm guns on rapid motorised mounts. As destroyers go, it is a fairly compact design, intended for fast manoeuvres at high speed."

OTT_destroyer_3:1 "Tatar Ramazan Class"
OTT_destroyer_3_desc:1 "While the Saffet-class may have been a strong design for hunting other destroyers, its smaller torpedo armament compared to its contemporaries limited its overall usefulness. As such, the Tatar Ramazan-class has cut back on the number of guns, being only three single 88mm guns this time, but three triple centreline 610mm torpedo tubes firing extended-range torpedoes, and a lengthened rear deck with additional depth charge launchers compared to the Saffet-class."

OTT_destroyer_4:1 "Piri Reis Class"
OTT_destroyer_4_desc:1 "The Piri Reis-class is a modern design, featuring fully enclosed motorised high-elevation dual-purpose turrets for its three 88mm guns, and five triple torpedo launchers. With one mounted behind the wheelhouse, and two on each side of the ship's midsection, it cannot get all its torpedoes in the water against a single target without heavy manoeuvring, but it can carry more of them than other destroyers of similar size with centreline launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Midilli Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "Originally Magdeburg-class light cruisers transferred from the German Hochseeflotte, starting with SMS Breslau, renamed Midilli. These ships' lighter armament than other contemporary cruisers, consisting of 12 105mm guns, was replaced with a more standard arrangement of 8 150mm guns in Ottoman service. Their small size and high speed made them useful as scout cruisers and blockade runners."

OTT_light_cruiser_1:1 "Kıbrıs Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Kıbrıs-class scout cruisers are late Weltkrieg designs intended for tracking Entente fleet movements in the Mediterranean and engaging targets of opportunity. To that end, they carried a fairly light 150mm gun armament, relying more on six twin side-mounted torpedo tubes for engaging any serious threats that they could not simply run away from. Their high-powered engines are maintenance-intensive, but they grant these ships a high cruise speed, and they can be pushed to their limits for brief periods if a rapid escape is called for."

OTT_light_cruiser_2:1 "Rodos Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "As land-based naval bombers and carrier-based naval aviation has become more and more common after the Weltkrieg, the Rodos-class was designed with an anti-air escort role in mind. Their primary armament is limited to six 150mm gun mounts, but they also carry ten high-elevation dual-purpose 77mm gun mounts and numerous autocannons and machine guns. Should they need to engage heavier surface ships, they can also still use their two triple torpedo launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_3:1 "Girit Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the lessons of the Rodos-class, the Girit-class carries significantly more surface-to-surface firepower. However, as the main role of these ships is still anti-air, it only carries three twin 150mm turrets, with the remaining eight guns in somewhat outdated casemate mounts on the side of the ship. This leaves room on the deck and superstructure for four fully-enclosed motorised twin 88mm dual-purpose turrets and six more single 88mm gun mounts. Provisions are also made for mounting an air detection radar."

OTT_light_cruiser_4:1 "Malta Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_4_desc:1 "With naval aviation becoming more prominent, and battleship anti-air suites more powerful, the role of the light cruiser as primarily an anti-air escort ship appears to be over. The Malta-class still carries potent anti-air firepower, helped by the fact that its main 150mm armament is now also mounted in dual-purpose turrets, but its torpedo armament has also been significantly expanded in order to expand its role as an agile anti-surface combatant. Two quadruple torpedo launchers on each side complement five twin 150mm gun turrets and two triple 88mm turrets, with the usual autocannons rounding out its armament."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Selim Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Selim-class is a heavy armoured cruiser design intended to accompany battleships in the battle line and engage smaller surface combatants like cruisers and destroyers while the capital ships slug it out. It carries a mixed primary armament of four 21cm guns, six 150mm guns, and eight 77mm guns. Its low speed is compensated for by its thick armour protection, allowing it to stand up to several battleship-calibre hits."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_1:1 "Sokullu Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Sokullu-class is a modern design for its time, carrying its eight main 21cm guns in four fully-enclosed superfiring turrets. However, despite carrying fewer smaller guns, this increased weight allocated to the armament means it does not boast armour as heavy as the Selim-class."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_2:1 "Köprülü Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Köprülü-class was designed to bring heavy firepower to bear at a budget. It is small for a heavy cruiser, and carries lighter armament than most others, in the form of three double 21cm turrets and four enclosed 150mm turrets, but this lowers its displacement enough compared to other contemporary heavy cruisers that its speed, manoeuvrability, and armour are all above average, while the cost stays relatively low."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_3:1 "Kırım Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:1 "More modern manufacturing techniques and assembly line construction allow the Kırım-class heavy cruisers to remain relatively low-cost, like their predecessor design, while offering increased combat capabilities. Five double 21cm turrets give it a very heavy broadside, but the awkward gun arrangement, with one forward turret, two superfiring rear turrets, and the remaining two turrets mounted amidships between the superstructure, means it has to fully expose its vulnerable side armour in order to get all guns firing at the same target."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_4:1 "Giray Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Giray-class does away with its predecessor's undesirable turret arrangement and instead uses three triple 21cm turrets to provide similar weight of fire in a more convenient manner. The addition of two of the new twin 150mm dual-purpose turrets significantly improve its anti-air firepower."

#Submarines"
IRE_submarine_1:0 "Holland Class"
IRE_submarine_1_desc:0 "Named after the Irish engineer who developed the first U-boat formally commissioned by the U.S Navy, the Holland Class is an early Irish attempt into the secretive world of U-boat warfare. It had numerous issues and saw very little actual service, but proved a useful platform to build on for future members of the U-boat family."
IRE_submarine_2:0 "Wolfhound Class"
IRE_submarine_2_desc:0 "The feared Wolfhound Class of U-boat proved to be a terror of the Irish sea during WK2. Commissioned explicitly on the orders of Michael Collins, who feared that a war with the Union of Britain might destroy his nation, the Wolfhound was a cheap yet powerful U-boat that carried an expansive arsenal of 8 torpedo tubes and made full use of the experimental Marfóir torpedo."
IRE_submarine_3:0 "Banshee Class"
IRE_submarine_3_desc:0 "A latter expansion upon the design of the Wolfhound, the Banshee was a larger U-boat that could operate at deeper levels and stay undetected. It was so named in honour of the female Irish fighter pilots who kept the skies above the Irish Sea safe whilst the Banshee did the same beneath the surface. Its scream may have often been silent, but it was no less deadly."
IRE_submarine_4:0 "Kelpie Class"
IRE_submarine_4_desc:0 "The most advanced U-boat of its kind during WK2, the Kelpie was a joint venture between German and Irish engineers, and had a much longer range than the previous designs, which were typically deployed in the Irish Sea and the Atlantic. The Kelpie could reach far further shores, and could conduct long-range trade warfare that posed a major threat to the Entente powers in particular."

### SWE - Sweden ###

# Light ships
SWE_submarine_1:0 "Hajen Class"
SWE_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Hajen, Bävern, Valen classes were a series of small to medium-sized U-boats built for the Swedish Navy during the 1920s. The Hajen class, commissioned in 1920, had U-boats that displaced nearly 400 tons and were armed with four 450mm torpedo tubes. They had a diving depth of only 30m."
 
SWE_submarine_2:0 "Sjölejonet Class"
SWE_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Sjölejonet-class consisted of nine U-boats built between 1936 and 1942. They were medium-sized subs, displacing 580 tons, and their design was heavily influenced by the Dutch O-class U-boats. They were armed with six 533mm torpedo tubes and had a diving depth of 60m. "

SWE_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
SWE_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Swedish U-class U-boats were a class of nine subs commissioned between 1942 and 1944. They were fairly small and relatively slow, displacing only 370 tons. They were armed with four 533mm torpedo tubes."

SWE_submarine_4:0 "Neptun Class"
SWE_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Neptun class consisted of three medium-sized U-boats that were all commissioned in 1943. They were used primarily for minelaying duties. They displaced 550 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."

SWE_destroyer_1:0 "Ehrensköld Class"
SWE_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The two destroyers of the Ehrensköld class were completed in 1927, as the first modern destroyers for Sweden following World War I. They displaced just over 970 tons and were armed with three 120mm/44 K/45 guns and six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a short range but good speed."

SWE_destroyer_2:0 "Göteborg Class"
SWE_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Göteborg-class consisted of six destroyers built between 1935 and 1942. They had a longer hull and improved machinery compared to their predecessors. They displaced just over 1,020 tons and had a main armament of 120mm/44 K/45 guns, and also six 533mm torpedo tubes. They had a limited range but excellent speed."

SWE_destroyer_3:0 "Visby Class"
SWE_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The four destroyers of the Visby class were all built between 1942 and 1944. They were similar to the earlier Göteborg class, but were larger, displacing over 1,130 tons. They also had improved engines, somewhat better range, and a strong ASW complement of equipment."

SWE_destroyer_4:0 "Öland Class"
SWE_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The two Öland-class destroyers represented a radical change from previous designs. They were launched and completed by the middle of the decade. They were large, displacing 1,880 tons. They were armed with four 120mm/45 M44 guns in their main armament, and had a strong AA, torpedo, and ASW complement. They were slightly slower than earlier destroyers, but had a significantly improved range."

SWE_light_cruiser_1:0 "Fylgia Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Fylgia was a relatively small armoured cruiser that was commissioned for the Swedish Navy in 1905. The performed mostly training duties during the war, and underwent an extensive refit in 1939-41. Prior to the refit, she displaced over 4,300 tons and was armed with six 152mm/45 K/50 M1903 guns in her main armament. She had good armour, but was relatively slow for a cruiser."
 
SWE_light_cruiser_2:0 "Gotland Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Gotland class cruiser was an innovative design from the early 1930s that combined the hull of a cruiser with a deck for seaplanes equipped with a catapult for take-off. As the 40s progressed the rapid development in air war made the planes she carried obsolete and she was converted to an air-defence cruiser."
 
SWE_light_cruiser_3:0 "Gripen Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Following the success of the Gotland cruiser militaristic wings of the Swedish government laid up plans to continue the development of the ship with a light cruiser capable of fulfilling the tasks of destroyers, attacking enemy sea-lanes and providing recon for the navy."
 
SWE_light_cruiser_4:0 "Tre Kronor Class"
SWE_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Tre Kronor class displaced just under 7,700 tons and had decent speed and range. Their main armament consisted of seven 152/53 M42 guns. They had a strong complement of AA guns, torpedoes and ASW equipment as well."
 
SWE_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Äran Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The backbone of the Swedish navy is the coastal battleships. More alike heavy cruisers in size they are heavily armed and armoured, giving comparably poor high-seas performance but able to put up a tough fight against any similarly sized ship in their home waters."
 
SWE_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Göta Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "With all Swedish coastal battleships having been built before or during the Weltkrieg it is high time to upgrade the navy with new equipment. The Göta class armoured cruiser is intended to fulfil this role, replacing the Äran and Sverige class coastal battleships."
 
SWE_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Norrland Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Norrland class is developed as an answer to the increasing requirement of being able to maintain a naval presence outside the littoral zone. Longer and with an improved engine compared to previous ships it would make for a strong backbone of the Swedish Navy."
 
SWE_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Svea Class"
SWE_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Following the success of the Norrland class heavy cruiser the Svea class improves on the weapon systems of her predecessor. Large enough to brave the open sea but nimble enough to fully take advantage of the Swedish archipelagos the Svea class is uniquely suited to her home."
 
SWE_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Sverige Class"
SWE_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Sverige class consisted of three coastal battleships built for the Swedish Navy before the Weltkrieg. The ships more closely resembled heavy cruisers in both size (displacement of over 6,800 tons) and armament (four 283mm/44 K/45 M12 guns). The ships were relatively slow for a cruiser but were very well-armored."
 
SWE_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Skandinavien Class"
SWE_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Continued development of the pre-Weltkrieg coastal battleships has led to the Skandinavien class. Larger and equipped with heavier guns it outmatches the old ships in all aspects."
 
SWE_battleship_1:1 "Kung Gustav II Adolf Class"
SWE_battleship_1_desc:1 "Following the weakening of Russia and the rise of Syndicalism in the west the Swedish threat perception shifted. With large parts of the powerful Royal navy now in the hands of the Union of Britain proposals were made to make new, more powerful ships that could engage the enemy not only in home waters, but out on the North Sea as well."
 
SWE_battleship_2:1 "Kung Karl XII Class"
SWE_battleship_2_desc:1 "The continued development of our high-seas navy is required to protect ourselves from the outside powers. An independent Sweden must be able to match the powerful navies of the world to maintain our position."
 
SWE_battleship_3:1 "Drottning Kristina Class"
SWE_battleship_3_desc:1 "While air power is starting to dominate the seas the power of a heavily armed battleship cannot be understated. With new range-finding technology and heavy anti-air armament the battleship can still remain relevant."
 
SWE_battleship_4:1 "Kung Karl XIV Johan Class"
SWE_battleship_4_desc:1 "With the development of naval air war progresses at a fast pace it is clear that old ships simply cannot keep up with the new weapons and new ships must be built. If Sweden is to have battleships at all, it must be the best."
 
SWE_SH_battleship_1:1 "Vasa Class"
SWE_SH_battleship_1_desc:1 "Ever since the age of sail the force a country can project at sea has been a measurement of its standing in the world. To fully realise our position, we need to build the largest and most powerful ship to sail the sea."
 
SWE_SH_battleship_2:1 "Kronan Class"
SWE_SH_battleship_2_desc:1 "Named after the regal ship that was the largest warship of its time during the 17th century, the Kronan-class battleship is intended to be the final word in the world of heavy battleships."
 
SWE_carrier_1:1 "Wachtmeister Class"
SWE_carrier_1_desc:1 "Naval theorists predict that naval air power is the future, and while the Gotland class seaplane cruiser is a step in the right direction we need to take it further, designing a ship that is specialised in carrying airplanes. Due to this radical reorganisation, it is only fitting that such ships would carry the names of the greatest organisers of the Swedish Navy through history."
 
SWE_carrier_2:1 "af Trolle Class"
SWE_carrier_2_desc:1 "While early suggestions of a specialised "hangar-ship" has them being converted from existing keels of capital ships or freighters it is becoming apparent that any fully-fledged navy will need a ship designed keel-up for the role as a carrier."
 
SWE_carrier_3:1 "Fleming Class"
SWE_carrier_3_desc:1 "As the world is starting to burn around us the destructive power of air superiority is becoming undeniable. It is becoming imperative to stay ahead in being able to wield such a force on the seas if Sweden is ever going to succeed as a blue-water navy."
