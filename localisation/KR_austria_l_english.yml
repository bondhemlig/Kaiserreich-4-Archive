AUS_military_expansion_desc:0 "Since the unification of Germany, the military has never truly been a priority for the Habsburgs, at least not to the extend of Germany or France or Russia. But now, with new threats both within and without, we simply cannot afford to sit idle. The Emperor has announced large scale funding increases to all of the three services, with more to come in the future."
AUS_military_inf:0 "Reinforce the K.u.K Infantry"
AUS_military_inf_desc:0 "Since time immemorial, the infantryman has been the most basic piece of the machinery of warfare. This simple truth is not likely to change anytime soon, and with the world slowing descending into chaos it is vital to strengthen that infantryman, who is all that stands between his country and chaos."
AUS_military_tank:0 "Create the K.u.K Panzertruppen"
AUS_military_tank_desc:0 "Previously, Panzers have been used in the army on an ad hoc basis, held in reserve to assist infantry advances and to fight enemy panzer units. Now, new ideas are permeating into the heads of the General Staff: ideas of war of mobility, panzers leading attacks and cutting through enemy lines. The establishment of an independent panzer corps is the first step to making these ideas reality."
AUS_military_mountaineers:0 "Reinforce the K.u.K Gebirgstruppe"

AUS_aviation_effort_desc:0 "During the Weltkreig, the small Austria air force acted almost as a branch of the German Luftstreitskräfte. Our pilots and planes have been even less of a priority than our navy, leaving it in a terrible state and virtually useless against any real power that might threaten us. It is imperative this situation change and the Luftfahrtruppen are reformed."

AUS_phoenix:0 "Phönix"
AUS_phoenix_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, a small company in Vienna, bearing the name Phönix company has supplied our air force by producing licensed German planes for our market.

AUS_naval_effort:0 "Reinforce the K.u.K Kriegsmarine"
AUS_naval_effort_desc:0 "The K.u.K Kriegsmarine has always been underfunded and unappreciated by the Austrian government and her people. Without a colonial empire the navy never had any real backing or strategic purpose. However, this is a dangerous mentality, and with new syndicalist threats in the Mediterranean, whole new Kriegsmarine is vital to protect our heartlands."
AUS_flexible_navy:0 "Flexible Warfare"
AUS_flexible_navy_desc:0 "Our naval staff have decided to pursue a doctrine surrounding U-boats and convoy raiding, in order to be able to afflict as much damage as possible without having to face the overwhelming power of the French and British navies.

AUS_capital_ships_effort:0 "Austrian Capital Ship Plan"
AUS_capital_ships_effort_desc:0 "The staff have begun a concerted effort to improve upon our battleship designs, bringing more firepower to our battles.

AUS_small_ships_effort:0 "Austrian Small Ship Plan"
AUS_small_ships_effort_desc:0 "It has been decided that we need new models for destroyers and light cruisers, to combat enemy submarines and establish a surface presence.

### Events ###
austria.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
austria.1.d:0 "Although Austria was on the winning side of the Weltkrieg, the war's main impact was to reveal the Empire's significant weaknesses and her utter dependence upon Germany. Over the course of the 1920s one disaster followed another. Emperor Karl died in 1922 causing the throne to pass to his 10 year old son Otto; and revolutionary tides rolled over the country that now was ruled by a ten-year-old. The humiliation of having to call in German mediation to resolve the crisis, which resulted in the concession of autonomy statutes given to Bohemia and Galicia, and the Creation of the South Slavic Kingdom of Illyria, seemed to signal the end of Austria as a Great Power. However, many feel that there is new hope for Österreich - now the Emperor Otto I has come of age and the terms of the 'Great Compromise' are to be renegotiated at the 1937 Ausgleich next year. Could this be the time for Austria to throw off her shackles of dependence on Germany and reassert the power of the Habsburg dynasty over her Empire?"
austria.1.a:0 "Lang lebe unser Kaiser!"

austria.2.t:0 "Austrian Elections"
austria.2.d:0 "Today the people of Austria will elect their representative to the Reichsrat. Austria is a mostly Catholic state, her most popular party being the social conservative 'Christlichsoziale Partei'. Her minor parties include the liberal 'Liberalpartei Österreichs' (representing liberals, Italian and Slovenian minorities, and protestant farmers), the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs' and the pangermanist 'Großdeutsche Partei'."
austria.2.a:0 "To no surprise, the 'Christlichsoziale Partei' wins the election."
austria.2.b:0 "As a major surprise, the 'Liberalpartei Österreichs' wins the election."
austria.2.c:0 "To minor surprise, the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs' wins the election."
austria.2.e:0 "Gott im Himmel! The 'Großdeutsche Partei' wins the election."

austria.3.t:0 "A New Ministerpräsident"
austria.3.d:0 "After an election, the Austrian Kaiser chooses a new Ministerpräsident."

austria.6.a:0 "Arthur Seyß-Inquart will bring us closer cooperation to Germany."
austria.6.b:0 "We need a strong hand! Create a military cabinet."

austria.7.t:0 "Syndicalist Revolts"
austria.7.d:0 "Following the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the activists of the forbidden Syndicalist Party of Austria have instigated several revolts in our major cities. Local garrisons have been sent to contain them, but since there is possibility that even our military is infiltrated by revolutionary elements, positive results are not certain."
austria.7.a:0 "The revolt succeeds."
austria.7.b:0 "Our armed forces stay loyal. The revolution is crushed."

austria.8.t:0 "Syndicalism in Austria"
austria.8.d:0 "Terrible news. Following the defeat in the Austro-Hungarian Civil War, the Austrian public is growing disillusioned with emperor Otto and current state of the Austrian Empire. This has been used by the wretched syndcialists, who were able to gain support of the public and parts of the armed forces, and with their help have overthrown the existing government. Such a development must not be allowed to continue, since even the existence of a syndicalist Austria seriously undermines the integrity of our western border. We can either send an ultimatum to the new syndicalist government to reform itself to our liking, and allow our military to occupy the Austrian capital, or we can declare war upon them immediately and end the threat now. What shall we do?"
austria.8.a:0 "Issue ultimatum to the syndicalist scum."
austria.8.b:0 "War will solve this."
austria.8.c:0 "We shall stand aside."

austria.9.t:0 "German Ultimatum"
austria.9.d:0 "The capitalist German dogs, in their madness, have decided to crush our newborn State by issuing a series of demands, which if accepted will reduce our country to nothing more than a German puppet. What shall we do?"
austria.9.a:0 "The Commune of France will assist us."
austria.9.b:0 "We have no choice."

austria.10.t:0 "Austrian Syndicalism endangered"
austria.10.d:0 "The newborn Austrian Syndicalist State is under threat from the German Empire. Most of the Jacobins are demanding immediate action even at the cost of premature war with the Germans. More level-headed Sorelians, along with many members of the military, argue that the time is not right to confront the German Empire."
austria.10.a:0 "Send an ultimatum to Berlin."
austria.10.b:0 "We cannot risk war with Germany."

austria.11.t:0 "Syndicalism established"
austria.11.d:0 "With Austria finally free of capitalist oppression, the people are finally able to become a true Syndicalist State. But what will the future bring?"
austria.11.a:0 "We will see."

austria.12.t:0 "Austrian Syndicalism submits"
austria.12.d:0 "The weakened Austrian state was forced to accept all of our economic and political demands, becoming a state of the German Empire in the process."
austria.12.a:0 "Heil dir im Siegeskranz."

austria.13.t:0 "French Ultimatum"
austria.13.d:0 "The Commune of France has issued us an ultimatum warning us that if we continue to pursue our policy against the newborn State of Austria, they will be obliged to come to their aid. How shall we react to this insolence?"
austria.13.a:0 "Fall back. We don't want war with France."
austria.13.b:0 "Ignore it."

austria.14.t:0 "Austria submits"
austria.14.d:0 "Without diplomatic support, the government of Austria had no other choice but to accept all German demands. Another threat to the security of the Kaiserreich has been averted and order has been restored."
austria.14.a:0 "Finally."

austria.15.t:0 "Our Ultimatum was ignored"
austria.15.d:0 "The arrogant German Empire has not even bothered to answer our ultimatum and is currently preparing both diplomatic and military action against the independent Syndicalist Austria. The only way we can protect Austria now is via declaring war against the German imperialists and their lapdogs."
austria.15.a:0 "This is too risky."
austria.15.b:0 "WAR!"

austria.16.t:0 "The Future of Austria"
austria.16.d:0 "With the syndicalists defeated, Germany is now in control of Austria. We have to decide what the future means for them. What shall we do?"
austria.16.a:0 "Unite them with Germany."
austria.16.b:0 "We will keep them as a protectorate."
austria.16.c:0 "Give them independence."

austria.17.t:0 "The Annexation of Austria"
austria.17.d:0 "Germany has decided to make us part of their Empire. Austria's history ends here."

austria.19.a:0 "Excellent."

austria.20.t:0 "Republic or Monarchy"
austria.20.d:0 "The time of the old reign is over and we need a new Government. What will the future bring?"
austria.20.a:0 "The return of the Monarchy."
austria.20.b:0 "We will be a Republic."

austria.21.t:0 "Fate of Transylvania"
