### Event text ###
 austria.1.t:0 "The Situation of Austria in 1936"
 austria.1.d:0 "Although Austria was on the winning side of the Weltkrieg, the war's main impact was to reveal the Empire's significant weaknesses and her utter dependence upon Germany. Over the course of the 1920s one disaster followed another. Emperor Karl died in 1922 causing the throne to pass to his 10 year old son Otto; Austrian industry collapsed in face of competition from German manufacturers; and the quarrels of the Czechs and ethnic Germans in Bohemia nearly pushed the Empire into civil war. Finally, the humiliation of having to call in German mediation to resolve the deadlock of the Ausgleich Negotiations in 1927, which resulted in the concession of autonomy statutes given to Bohemia and Galicia, seemed to signal the end of Austria as a Great Power. However, many feel that there is new hope for the Österreich - now the Emperor Otto I has come of age and the terms of the 'Great Compromise' are to be renegotiated at the 1937 Ausgleich next year. Could this be the time for Austria to throw off her shackles of dependence on Germany and reassert the power of the Habsburg dynasty over her Empire?"
 austria.1.a:0 "Lang lebe unser Kaiser!"
 
 austria.2.t:0 "Austrian Elections"
 austria.2.d:0 "Today the people of Austria will elect their representative to the Reichsrat. Austria is a mostly Catholic state, her most popular party being the social conservative 'Christlichsoziale Partei'. Her minor parties include the liberal 'Liberalpartei Österreichs' (representing liberals, Italian and Slovenian minorities, and protestant farmers), the 'Sozialdemokratische Arbeiterpartei Österreichs' and the pangermanist 'Großdeutsche Partei'."

 austria.7.d:0 "Following the crumbling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the activists of the forbidden Syndicalist Party of Austria have instigated several revolts in our major cities. Local garrisons have been sent to contain them, but since there is possibility that even our military is infiltrated by revolutionary elements, positive results are not certain."
 austria.7.a:0 "The revolt succeeds."
 austria.7.b:0 "Our armed forces stay loyal. The revolution is crushed."
 
 austria.8.t:0 "Syndicalism in Austria"
 austria.8.d:0 "Terrible news. Following the defeat in the Austro-Hungarian Civil War, the Austrian public is growing disillusioned with emperor Otto and current state of the Austrian Empire. This has been used by the wretched syndcialists, who were able to gain support of the public and parts of the armed forces, and with their help have overthrown the existing government. Such a development must not be allowed to continue, since even the existence of a syndicalist Austria seriously undermines the integrity of our western border. We can either send an ultimatum to the new syndicalist government to reform itself to our liking, and allow our military to occupy the Austrian capital, or we can declare war upon them immediately and end the threat now.

More level-headed Sorelians, along with many members of the military, argue that the time is not right to confront the German Empire."
 austria.10.a:0 "Send an ultimatum to Berlin."

 austria.21.a:0 "Send an ultimatum to Bucharest."
 austria.21.b:0 "We do not need it anymore."

 austria.22.t:0 "Fate of Transylvania"
 austria.22.d:0 "Today we received a demand that we give back our lands in Transylvania that we liberated from Hungarian reign the Civil War. If we refuse their outrageous demands we can expect an immediate invasion. How shall we respond?"

 austria.26.t:0 "Racial Tensions escalate"

 austria.28.d:0 "Miklós Horthy, born in 1868 in the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy, has served in the K.u.K. Kriegsmarine during the Weltkrieg, during which he was promoted to being an Admiral.

 austria.28.a:0 "This is not good."

 austria.29.t:0 "The Movement grows in Numbers"
