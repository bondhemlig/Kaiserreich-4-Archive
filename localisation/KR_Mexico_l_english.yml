### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_EMILIANO_ZAPATA_DESC:0 "Emiliano Zapata, hero of the Mexican Revolution, achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through political compromise, fostered closer diplomatic ties with the Commune of France. Zapata, however, faces strong opposition from other socialist factions, as well as remenants of the old regime."
POLITICS_PLUTARCO_CALLES_DESC:0 "General Plutarco Calles has seized control of the Mexican government. While the totalitarian and rabidly anti-clerical tone of Calles's rhetoric are typical of Mexican socialist politicians, his rejection of agrarianism and support for full integration of indigenous Mexicans could represent a radical new direction for Mexico if implemented."
POLITICS_PANCHO_VILLA_DESC:0 "Francisco 'Pancho' Villa's military victories against the armies of dictator Victoriano Huerta, such critical steps on the path to socialist revolution in Mexico, remain legendary in Mexico and abroad. Villa, while often at odds with Zapata, is similarly an agrarian socialist."
POLITICS_PABLO_GONZALEZ_GARZA_DESC:0 "General Pablo Gonzalez Garza was once a steadfast ally of former president Carranza. With the death of Carranza and the ascent of Alvaro Obregón to the Mexican presidency, he went into hiding, waiting for the opportune moment to cleanse his beloved Mexico of socialist corruption; with the success of a military coup in Mexico, he is poised to do just that."
POLITICS_JOSE_URQUIZA_DESC:0 "Jose Antonia Urquiza, fervent catholic and anti-socialist, has outmaneuvred his ostensible allies within the Mexican military to assume control of the presidency. President Urquiza is as certain to promote faith in his Sinarquist regime as faith in God Himself."
POLITICS_VINCENTE_TOLEDANO_DESC:0 "Vicente Toledano, personal aide and confidant of former president, Zapata, has now become president in his own right. He advocates a synthesis between European style syndicalism and Mexican agrarianism, whereby the state supports the industrialisation and unionisation of the collectivised farms, 'Ejidos'."
POLITICS_LAZARO_CARDENAS_DESC:0 "Lazaro Cardenas of the moderate Partido Revolucionario Institucional has achieved victory in Mexico's presidential election. His platform is of reconciliation with Zapatistas and the Catholic Church alike."
POLITICS_DONA_ITURBIDE_DESC:0 "Doña María Josephia Sophia de Habsburgo-Itúrbide has been crowned Empress of the new Mexican Monarchy. She traces descent from both Mexico's final indigenous Emperor and the adopted son of Maximillian. As an Austrian, her ascension to the throne has fostered closer ties between Austria and Mexico."
POLITICS_DON_FERNANDO:0 "Don Fernando de Tultengo has been crowned King of Mexico. His legitimacy is based upon descent from the final Aztec Tlatoani, Moctezuma, and thus he lacks the dynastic links which could entangle the fate of Mexico with that of another."

mexico.1.d:0 "Breaking news from Mexico City! This morning, as he was about to attend a meeting with local syndicalists in the Zócalo square, president Emiliano Zapata was stabbed in the head with an ice-pick by an unknown assailant!

mexico.7.t:0 "Ramón Mercader under arrest"
mexico.7.d:0 "Just a few hours ago, the police has managed to arrest Ramón Mercader in connection to the attack on Emiliano Zapata!

mexico.7.c:0 "Arrest Calles and all those involved in this conspiracy!"
mexico.8.t:0 "Presidential Elections, 1936"

The many factions of the hegemonic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM), from the mainstream Villistas and Zapatistas to the anarchist Magonistas, the Social-Democrats and even the fringe Totalists, have all fielded their own candidates. Challenges for our next president range from internal political opposition to instability in the USA across the Rio Grande."

mexico.8.b:0 "Vincente Toledano, the dean of Mexican Syndicalism"
mexico.8.c:0 "Plutarco Elías Calles, the hard-line general"
mexico.8.e:0 "Lazaro Cardenas, the middle-ground moderate"
mexico.9.t:0 "Reclaiming our lost territories"
mexico.9.d:0 "In 1848, as a result of our defeat in the Mexican-American War, we were forced to cede nearly half of our territory to the United States as per the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The reversion of this treaty has been a dream for the Mexican people since then. Now, with the USA at war, this could be our chance to regain our lost lands and reassert Mexican control north of the Rio Grande, from California all the way to Texas!"
mexico.9.a:0 "Demand the return of our territories"
mexico.9.b:0 "We can't afford direct conflict, just stake our claims"
mexico.9.c:0 "Are you mad? This is too dangerous!"
mexico.10.t:0 "Mexican territorial demands"
mexico.10.d:0 "Mexico has decided to use the ongoing American Civil War as an opportunity to reclaim the territories they lost to us due to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo! How should we react?"
mexico.10.a:0 "Cede disputed territory, we can't afford another front"
mexico.10.b:0 "Never! Those lands are American!"
mexico.11.t:0 "The Americans refuse our demands"
mexico.11.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the United States has refused to accept our rightful territorial claims. What shall we do now?"
mexico.11.a:0 "War will solve this!"
mexico.11.b:0 "We are not ready for war"
mexico.12.t:0 "The second Mexican-American War"
mexico.12.d:0 "Our refusal to accept the Mexican territorial claims was the last straw. They decided to declare war upon us in order to try to gain those disputed territories by force. Now, troops of the National Guard, together with volunteers from local population, are being mobilised to repel the Mexican assaults!"
mexico.12.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
mexico.13.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.13.d:0 "We've successfully beaten the American army and conquered the disputed border states. Now, we can send their humiliated leadership a peace in which they promise to recognise our territorial gains and withdrawn from disputed territory, however we could keep going in this war to try and get more land. What should we do?"
mexico.13.a:0 "Sue for peace, we have had enough"
mexico.13.b:0 "We shall reclaim all of our lands"
mexico.14.t:0 "We have lost much of our territory!"
mexico.14.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. The Mexicans have offered us peace, with their troops threatening to advance even deeper, this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico.14.a:0 "Accept their claims, we must end this war right now"
mexico.14.b:0 "No compromise until we are marching on their capital"
mexico.15.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.15.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans must cede a good part of their territory to us"
mexico.15.a:0 "Hooray!"
mexico.16.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.16.d:0 "We've successfully beaten the American army and conquered the disputed border states.

mexico.16.a:0 "Sue for peace"
mexico.17.t:0 "Peace offer from Mexico"
mexico.17.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. The Mexicans have offered us peace, with their troops threatening to advance even deeper, this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."
mexico.17.a:0 "Accept The Offer"
mexico.17.b:0 "Decline The Offer"
mexico.18.t:0 "The Treaty of Acapulco"
mexico.18.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Acapulco, the Americans must cede all the lands we ceded to them in our last war back to us"
mexico.18.a:0 "Hooray!"
mexico.27.t:0 "The United States accepts our demands"
mexico.27.d:0 "Surprisingly it seems that the Americans were willing to hand over all of the land they seized in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo without a fight. Their internal problems must be brutal indeed!"
mexico.27.a:0 "Our rightful northern lands restored!"
mexico.28.t:0 "War against the Pacific States?"
mexico.28.d:0 "Another rebel faction of the American Civil War, the Pacific States of America, currently control an area composed of the western seaboard - this includes our rightful territories of Alta California. We should attack them immediately!"
mexico.28.a:0 "Attack!"
mexico.28.b:0 "We are tired of conflict already"
mexico.29.t:0 "Victory over the Pacific States"
mexico.29.d:0 "The Mexican army has overcome the armies of the Pacific States of America and are now in a position to demand terms. Some in the government want the whole of California to be returned to Mexico but others feel that aggressive demands will lead to another possible war in the future."
mexico.29.a:0 "Demand all of California"
mexico.29.b:0 "Demand the southern half of California"
mexico.29.c:0 "Continue the Offensive, the Pacific coast shall be ours"
mexico.30.t:0 "Mexico demands all of California"
mexico.30.d:0 "We have been beaten by Mexico in the war and they have demanded Arizona and all of California. The people want to keep resisting but there may be no options left..."
mexico.30.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
mexico.30.b:0 "No deal, we fight to the end"
mexico.31.t:0 "Mexico demands Southern California"
mexico.31.d:0 "We have been beaten by Mexico in the war and they have demanded Arizona and Southern California. The people want to keep resisting but there may be no options left."
mexico.31.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
mexico.31.b:0 "No deal, fight to the end"
mexico.32.t:0 "The PSA accepts Our Demands"
mexico.32.d:0 "The PSA has seen the wisdom of accepting our demands and we can now look forward to having California back. This is a great day for Mexico."
mexico.32.a:0 "Excellent"
mexico.33.t:0 "The PSA refuses our demands"
mexico.33.d:0 "The PSA has refused to accept our demands and now we must destroy them."
mexico.33.a:0 "Bastards"
mexico.34.t:0 "PSA troops occupy Baja California"
mexico.34.d:0 "Troops of the Pacific States have occupied the Baja California peninsula of Mexico! With our troops about to advance deeper into Mexico, maybe this is the perfect opportunity for press claims for a peace settlement to our advantage."
mexico.34.a:0 "Send the envoys"
mexico.34.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City"
mexico.35.t:0 "Peace proposal from the Pacific States"
mexico.35.d:0 "Troops of the Pacific States have occupied the Baja California peninsula of Mexico! With their troops about to advance deeper into Mexico, they have seized the opportunity and sent their envoys to negotiate a peace settlement that is most advantageous to them. Should we accept their claims to Baja California and end the conflict?"
mexico.35.a:0 "Accept their offer"
mexico.35.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Sacramento"
mexico.35.c:0 "Continue the war, we will crush the PSA"
mexico.36.t:0 "Old and new dynasties"
mexico.36.d:0 "As our government has decided to restore the Mexican monarchy, now we must decide which dynasty shall ascend to the throne. Should we invite Doña María Anna Tunkl-Iturbide, of the House of Habsburg-Itúrbide? Since she is, famously, granddaughter of Salvador de Itúrbide (grandson of our first emperor Agustín and an adopted son of our second monarch Maximilian I), she would be most appreciated by the traditional Catholics, conservative politicians and would put us on good relations with the European powers. On the other hand, a 'nativist' clique has emerged, supporting the claims of Don Fernando de Teruel, current holder of the Spanish title of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo - thus, a descendent of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II."
mexico.36.a:0 "Support the claims of Doña María Anna de Habsburgo-Itúrbide"
mexico.36.b:0 "Choose Don Fernando, the Duke of Moctezuma"
mexico.37.t:0 "The Sinarquistas Attack!"
mexico.37.d:0 "The top leadership of the Unión Nacional Sinarquista are at this moment attempting a coup against our government! Hundreds of their Goldshirt militias have surrounded the Palacio Nacional, while rumour has it that army troops sympathetic to their cause are rushing towards Mexico City. They demand the surrender of the current cabinet and their replacement by their own party!"
mexico.37.a:0 "The Sinarquistas succeed and establish a new government"
mexico.38.t:0 "The Anglo Rebellion"
mexico.38.d:0 "The vast majority of the population in our new northern states are English speaking "Anglos" who are resisting our rule. They are well armed and many fear that they will try to rebel against us."
mexico.38.a:0 "The Gringos will learn to accept our rule"
mexico.39.t:0 "Gringo Riots!"
mexico.39.d:0 "The Anglo population in our occupied territories have staged a number of protests, ranging from peaceful gatherings and illegal parades to major protests and acts of vandalism. Obviously, it will take a really, really long time until these gringos accept our rightful rule over Tejas, Nuevo Mexico and Alta California…"
mexico.39.a:0 "Riots occur in major cities"
mexico.40.t:0 "Actions of the Anglo resistance"
mexico.40.d:0 "The resistance of the Anglo population against our occupation forces continues. Once again, terrorist groups operating within the Northern territories have staged a number of attacks aimed on crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output and the morale of our forces."
mexico.40.a:0 "Saboteurs bomb a number of important factories"
mexico.40.b:0 "Guerrilleros sabotage our transport infrastructure"
mexico.40.c:0 "Guerrilleros stage organised hit-and-run raids against our troops"
mexico.41.t:0 "Major Anglo Offensive!"
mexico.41.d:0 "We are under attack! Leaders of the Anglo resistance in the North have launched a major coordinated uprising against our troops!"
mexico.41.a:0 "¡Oh! Y ahora, ¿Quién podrá defenderme?"
mexico.42.t:0 "Attack by Anglo guerrillas!"
mexico.42.d:0 "The Anglo insurrectionists in the North have launched a full-on assault against our occupation forces!"
mexico.42.a:0 "Damn them!"
mexico.45.t:0 "The anti-clerical policies of Mexico"
mexico.45.d:0 "Our president is a known militant atheist and an opponent of the Catholic Church. Over the past months, he and his close advisers have begun to move to enforce the anti-clerical articles of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 — including provisions such as depriving the Church of its property rights and depriving the clergy of a number of civil liberties."
mexico.45.a:0 "Yes, begin persecution of the Catholic Church"
mexico.46.t:0 "Catholic unrest"
mexico.46.d:0 "The Catholics in our country are not reacting well to our persecution of their church, and they are beginning to rebel against us. Should the persecution continue?"
mexico.46.a:0 "Keep up the anti-clerical campaign"
mexico.46.b:0 "They already had enough, suspend further persecution"
mexico.47.t:0 "The Cristero Uprising begins"
mexico.47.d:0 "The anti-Catholic persecution of our president has caused a number of rebellions in Central Mexico. Local peasants, aided by conservative politicians and the remainders of the Catholic hierarchy, have taken up arms! Rallying under the banner of the Cristo Rey and Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, these bandits have pledged to defend their right to practice their faith!"
mexico.47.a:0 "To arms!"
mexico.48.t:0 "Catholic uprising in Mexico"
mexico.48.d:0 "The anti-Catholic persecution undertaken by Mexico's socialist president has reached such outrageous results that tens of thousands of peasants have taken up arms against the government! Aided by the remnants of the old elites and local priests, these rebels are rallying under the banners of El Cristo Rey and Nuestra Señora de Guadaloupe and pledged to defend their faith! Some members of our foreign service have proposed that we send supplies and volunteers to help this rebellion."
mexico.48.a:0 "Support them, send supplies and volunteers"
mexico.48.b:0 "We should not get involved"
mexico.49.t:0 "Italian involvement in La Cristiada"
mexico.49.d:0 "The Papist government of Italy has lent their support to the Catholic uprising in Central Mexico. Hundreds of their military advisers and a good cache of arms have arrived to the rebel-held lands. We can't tolerate their meddling in our internal affairs!"
mexico.49.a:0 "Damn them!"
mexico.50.t:0 "The end of the Cristero Uprising"
mexico.50.d:0 "The Mexican Army, after a tough fight, has managed to defeat the Cristero Uprising, also known as La Cristiada. At last, Mexico is free from the perfidious influence of the Catholic Church! We can now continue our reforms and keep up with our project of transforming the country into a respected atheist republic."
mexico.50.a:0 "At last, establish official state atheism"
mexico.51.t:0 "Calles Embraces Totalism"
mexico.51.d:0 "After his return flight from the Union of Britain there are rumours that he is working on a new project to reform the Partido and advance his brand of Totalism here in Mexico..."
mexico.51.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't come to that"
mexico.52.t:0 "Fate of Hollywood"
mexico.52.d:0 "With Alta California finally ours again, we need to decide what to do with its film industry, once a pillar of U.S. capitalist propaganda. The Comité is divided between leaving them be (barring our new film censorship and approval board), expropriation, and purging the area to build something far more useful for el pueblo. While industrialising the studios would boost California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our new citizens Norteños will be upset…"
mexico.52.a:0 "Leave them alone, remember they helped finance los Villistas"
mexico.52.b:0 "Consolidate the studios under government control"
mexico.52.c:0 "Hollywood belongs to its workers!"
mexico.52.e:0 "Purge the studios and build heavy industry!"
mexico.53.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Territories"
mexico.53.d:0 "National elation over La Reconquista continues in full swing. Unfortunately, overwhelming euphoria is not without its overzealous drawbacks. Recently, certain national activists, civil administrators and other (generally traditionalist) voices have advocated that since the old northern territories have returned to us, we should likewise return the nature of their civil administration along revanchist lines - that is, the former U.S. states should be redrawn to match the pre-1848 borders of Alta California, Nuevo Mexico, Texas, even the Oregon Territory if our new gains allow it. These 'conservatives' argue that such a reorganisation would centralise administration of the old U.S. states and streamline governance over the North while exalting Mexican pride and erasing the estadounidense colonialism over Mexico's ancestral lands. The 'progressive' faction, meanwhile, dismiss these borders as vague even for the time, and further denounce the scheme as archaic, impractical and bound to outrage the Anglos more than ever. Instead, the progressives argue, the established former U.S. State administrations are already functional, well-organised and stable, and therefore should be adopted in full and merely expanded upon. Today, the Comité de Ocupación del Norte is scheduled hold a meeting and to adjourn with a decision on the matter."
mexico.53.a:0 "Conservative: Revert to traditional borders"
mexico.53.b:0 "Progressive: Expand on existing state apparatus"
mexico.54.t:0 "The Fate of the Alamo"
mexico.54.d:0 "It was inevitable that the question of that decaying symbol known as the Alamo would arise. As it stands, the Alamo is a rallying point for insurrectionists and a shrine for the old regime. Therefore, a resolution has been called for to renovate the building and thus repurpose its symbolic value — but again, this may only serve to incur the wrath of the gringos. As per the directive of the Comité de Ocupación del Norte, the Alamo will be…"
mexico.54.a:0 "Preserved as a cultural heritage site"
mexico.54.b:0 "A war dead memorial"
mexico.54.c:0 "Demolished! With urban expansion built over it for good measure!"
mexico.55.t:0 "The Status of American Indians"
mexico.55.d:0 "With a change in government it is only natural that ostracised groups will seek support from the new government in hopes of finally overturning their fortunes. In this case, it is America's first peoples, with which we share a lineage of American nativity and European colonialism. Deprived also of their territory, as well as their sovereignty, Indians now live like zoo animals in reservations, where poverty is rampant, and the Indian Citizenship Act of 1936 does not go far enough in repairing centuries of subjugation. Therefore, we should expand on the act, as it is our moral imperative that we grant assistance to the destitute American Indian and begin lifting them from oppression at last."
mexico.55.a:0 "Yes, we stand alongside the oppressed Indian"
mexico.55.b:0 "Will we ever stop enraging the Americans with all the guns?!"
mexico.56.t:0 "Status of Women in the Territories"
mexico.56.d:0 "Anglo women have taken to the streets in planned demonstrations — not against Mexican occupation, but for women's rights. While generally critical of Mexico's actions, suffragists have decided to make the best of our progressive government and have thus petitioned Mexico to succeed where Washington failed — officially extend Mexico's Constitutional rights of women to the territories."
mexico.56.a:0 "Grant universal rights for all women!"
mexico.56.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
mexico.56.c:0 "Now is not the best time"
mexico.57.t:0 "Status of Religion in the Territories"
mexico.57.d:0 "While Mexico has historically been a Catholic country, the Anglos take on the religious heritage of England, Protestantism. The people in the territories — Texas in particular — are deeply religious, so the Comité has to tread carefully on religious policy. It would be foolish, however, to ignore intelligence reports from our spy service which emphasise how the local churches are condoning, aiding and abetting the insurrectionists, many of whom are zealous Protestants themselves."
mexico.57.a:0 "Enforce Catholicism as the state religion"
mexico.57.b:0 "Enforce anti-clerical laws of 1917 Constitution"
mexico.57.c:0 "Let the Protestants freely go about their business"
mexico.58.t:0 "Status of Language in the Territories"
mexico.58.d:0 "The majority of both the Mexican and Anglo populations do not speak the others' language, which is already causing incidents in the territories. While forcing the entire Anglo population to learn and speak Spanish would be… impractical, perhaps some basic public works could assist our troops and settlers in the North. The principal subject of today's Comité meeting is: From schools and government to restaurants and street signs, what will be the official language in the territories?"
mexico.58.a:0 "Español"
mexico.58.b:0 "Bilingüe/Bilingual"
mexico.58.c:0 "English"
mexico.59.t:0 "The Reintegration of the Mexican Cession"
mexico.59.d:0 "After many years of extensive resettlement, intensive propaganda efforts and numerous crushed uprisings, organised revolt against Mexican governance has largely subsided. While some resistance persists among old militia extremists, Anglos at large have gradually come to terms with our rule and settlers are now a significant minority in the North. With Los Territorios Reconquistados firmly under our control, we've won unhindered access to its resources and industry."
mexico.59.a:0 "Finally!"
mexico.60.t:0 "Restructuring The Regime"
mexico.60.d:0 "The Junta has now ruled for quite a while, and keeping the people under control has been difficult, some are calling for a restructuring of the regime, and we are faced with 3 options. The first option is to find an ally for the Junta, either the Industrialists or the Hacienderos, The second option is to restore the monarchy to try and gain legitimacy for our regime, The third option is to invite the Sinarquistas into our government to gain another ally in Mexico. What should we choose?"

Despite a well-organised campaign of both non-violent resistance and guerrilla attacks by the local Anglo population, we are determined to continue our occupation. Now, with their Civil War over, the American government is demanding that we return them these former territories. And, according to our intelligence reports, they are even considering going to war against Mexico for this! Even if we know that we have a historical right to those lands, we must keep in mind that the Americans are much more strong and organised now - it is very possible that, in case of war, we may not resist their offensive."

MEX_Embrace_Totalism_desc:0 "Plutarco Calles has managed to seize power following the much-regretted assassination of Emiliano Zapata. His vision for Mexico's future does sound dreary to plenty, but it does seem to hold some promise."
MEX_Establish_the_Maximato:0 "Establish The Maximato"
MEX_Establish_the_Maximato_desc:0 "With the spineless adepts of Cardénas and Zapata cast aside, it is time for Calles to truly begin building the Revolution in Mexico. His leadership will turn us into a true beacon of socialism in the Americas, one that will last until the sun sets down for the last time!"
MEX_Crack_Down_On_Strikes:0 "Crack Down On Strikes"
MEX_Crack_Down_On_Strikes_desc:0 "The trade unions, while claimed to be an integral part of Socialism, have proven to be extremely uncooperative to the new regime. As Socialism can't be built without its workforce, the Chairman has decided to place them under state control, for the good of the Revolution."
MEX_State_Atheism:0 "State Atheism"
MEX_State_Atheism_desc:0 "Religion is said to be the opiate of the masses, and it certainly shows in Mexico, where it keeps being a thorn in the developing Maximato's side. Our regime will dissociate itself from the Catholics and their values, the Mexican people will develop a new ethos under our leadership."
MEX_New_Education_System:0 "New Education System"
MEX_New_Education_System_desc:0 "The future of Mexico rests in its youth, and the Chairman recognises this. Through a vast reform of the education system, based on socialist principles, we will instil in the future generations the zeal needed to keep the torch of the Maximato burning."

MEX_Republican_Guard_desc:0 "The reactionaries' honeyed words may still sway people to their cause, in spite of the numerous advances Mexico has made under the leadership of Chairman Calles.

MEX_Expand_Intel:0 "Expand The Intelligence"

MEX_Control_the_Ejidos:0 "Take Control Of The Ejidos"
MEX_Control_the_Ejidos_desc:0 "The Ejido system of communal agriculture, while it has proven liberating to the average Mexican farmer, may hold some potential for corruption and subversion. To make sure it remains free from the reactionary taint, greater control will be exerted over these lands."
MEX_Military_Industrialisation:0 "Military Industrialisation"
MEX_Military_Industrialisation_desc:0 "Our eternal enemies, the Capitalists in general and the United States in particular, need to be kept at bay. While our rugged terrain is an useful shield by itself, we need to bolster the arms industry, as we cannot rely on imports from our overseas Socialist colleagues or from the Capitalists."
MEX_Mexican_Cars:0 "Mexican Automobile Industry"
MEX_Mexican_Cars_desc:0 "Before the Mexican Revolution, foreign autovehicle manufacturers started investing in our country. They did leave in the meantime, but their factories and some managers did not.

MEX_Modernise_The_Ejidos:0 "Modernise The Ejidos"
MEX_Modernise_The_Ejidos_desc:0 "We will continue the liberation of the Mexican farmer by mechanizing and modernising the Ejido system. The higher yields we will garner from such an act will be essential towards the future of our people and of the Revolution."
MEX_Steel_Production:0 "Construct Steel Factories"

MEX_Industrial_Mobilisation_desc:0 "Mexico is rich in resources, is rapidly industrializing, and the Chairman's vision of Mexican socialism is rapidly gaining steam.

MEX_Nationalise_Oil:0 "Nationalise The Oil Industry"

MEX_Legacy_Of_Zapata:0 "Legacy Of Zapata"
MEX_Legacy_Of_Zapata_desc:0 "Cardénas' men will end up betraying the revolution, and Calles will lead Mexico to ruin. Only by fostering the seeds of socialism planted by Emiliano Zapata and his aide Vicente Toledano will the Mexican people reach their true potential within a revolutionary framework."
MEX_Mexican_Socialism:0 "Mexican Socialism"
MEX_Mexican_Socialism_desc:0 "Owing to our isolation from the other Syndicalist countries, as well as to our revolution's independent nature from the ones in Europe, it is only normal that we should continue building upon this unique foundation, and promote the development of an uniquely Mexican form of socialism."
MEX_Empower_Ejidos:0 "Empower The Ejidos"
MEX_Empower_Ejidos_desc:0 "The communal Ejidos shall form the foundation of Mexican socialism. We shall establish a few regulations to govern ejido maintenance, but otherwise their usage and internal land distribution will be left to them. As Zapata himself said, The earth belongs to its tillers."
MEX_Agricultural_Economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"

MEX_Develop_Natural_Resources:0 "Develop Natural Resources"
MEX_Develop_Natural_Resources_desc:0 "Mexico was and remains a nation rich in minerals and ores. Through investments, we will soon tap into our great underground wealth, and take another step on the road to Mexican Socialism. That which once sustained Empires shall now sustain its people."
MEX_Increase_Exports:0 "Increase Exports"
MEX_Increase_Exports_desc:0 "It is high time we began to export some of our vast resources. Not all countries have the same standard as ours, obviously, but we can only benefit; more developed nations will appreciate the international cooperation, and the lesser-developed might be inclined to take the road of Socialism!"
MEX_Expand_Ejidos:0 "Expand Ejidos"

MEX_Improve_Conditions:0 "Improve Working Conditions"
MEX_Improve_Conditions_desc:0 "Our vast social programs are worth nothing if the working conditions themselves are stuck in the 19th century. Fortunately, the President has more than a few reforms planned to improve the Mexican worker's situation, all that we really need to do is sign them into law."
MEX_Native_Aut:0 "Native Autonomy"
MEX_Native_Aut_desc:0 "Long have the indigenous peoples of Mexico been mistreated by corrupt governments. With the development of Mexican Socialism, however, that will change; they will get more autonomy in their internal affairs and land administration. Perhaps they might prove a good model for the ejido system."
MEX_Ejido_Militias:0 "Ejido Militias"
MEX_Ejido_Militias_desc:0 "Now that the fruit of their own labour belongs to them, it is time to pass some self-policing and self-defence duties to the ejidos as well. While the Army will retain its role, the Ejido militias will act as an useful territorial defence force."
MEX_Adopt_Syndicalism:0 "Adopt Syndicalism"
MEX_Adopt_Syndicalism_desc:0 "We may have had our revolution unfold separately from the ones in Europe, however, in the name of internationalism and the World Revolution, we must adopt a more orthodox form of syndicalism. This move, while it may distance us from our roots, will bring us more support from overseas."
MEX_Empower_Unions:0 "Empower The Unions"
MEX_Empower_Unions_desc:0 "The trade unions are the foundation of Syndicalism; one cannot exist without the other. As we are moving towards Syndicalism, we should empower the Syndicates, to allow them to take their rightful place in our society."
MEX_Encourage_Urbanization:0 "Encourage Urbanisation"
MEX_Encourage_Urbanization_desc:0 "As much as we support the countryside of Mexico, we have to admit that vast parts of it are not that suited to agriculture. Instead of seeking to make productive what is now desert, we should encourage the downtrodden to seek their future in cities; we will increase their living standards as well as create a bigger proletarian basis for our regime."
MEX_Union_Ejido_Coop:0 "Union-Ejido Cooperation"
MEX_Union_Ejido_Coop_desc:0 "Adopting Syndicalism doesn't mean that we can leave aside the uniquely Mexican component entirely.

MEX_Establish_The_CTM_desc:0 "In the vein of the British TUC and the French CGT, we must establish our own body to regulate and oversee the syndical activity in Mexico. The new Confederation of Mexican Workers will be an example on the continent."
MEX_Teacher_Union:0 "Teacher's Union Demands"
MEX_Teacher_Union_desc:0 "With the trade unions being empowered, the Teacher's Union has brought before us a set of demands. A good sign of growing revolutionary consciousness in Mexico, but are they worthy of being implemented?"
MEX_Railway_Union:0 "Railway Worker's Union Demands"
MEX_Railway_Union_desc:0 "The Railway Worker syndicates have come before us with petitions of their own! They will be again subject to review before a possible implementation, but this is excellent news for the Mexican revolution!"
MEX_Miner_Union:0 "Miner's Union Demands"

MEX_Cardenas_Land_Reform:0 "Land Reform"
MEX_Cardenas_Land_Reform_desc:0 "The Ejido system is empowering to the Mexican worker, however there may be some people who want to be the sole owner of their own lands. This by itself is not bad, it is only an expression of our theory. We will make private land acquisition easier, whilist not undermining the Ejido system, which will remain our backbone."
MEX_Guarentee_Rights:0 "Guarantee Worker's Rights"
MEX_Guarentee_Rights_desc:0 "The workers may be more empowered now than under the Porfiriato, but what use is this if the regime goes astray? We will take the obvious step and produce a Charter of Worker's Rights, which will be inviolable by anything and anyone in Mexico."
MEX_Improve_Transportation_System:0 "Improve Transportation System"
MEX_Improve_Transportation_System_desc:0 "Mexico is a very large country, with a host of diverse climates, from the arid lands of the north to the jungles of the Yucatan. We should begin to build and improve the infrastructure needed to finally tie the whole country together."
MEX_Compromise_With_The_Church:0 "Compromise With The Church"
MEX_Compromise_With_The_Church_desc:0 "While the Church's influence has led to some mishaps in the past, our regime recognises that some of the values it preaches can be useful to the people of Mexico. We should easen up some of the anti-clerical policies, and formally sign a concordat with the Church, delieating the separation between the two spheres in a more civilised manner."
MEX_Rural_Education:0 "Rural Education"
MEX_Rural_Education_desc:0 "Developing our countryside, while important to Mexico's prosperity, is worth little if the future generations do not know what we have managed to build thus far, and thus how to mantain and develop it further. We will increase funding to the Ministry of Education and roll out rural education programs to bring the benefits of civilisation to every corner of Mexico."
MEX_Compromise_With_The_Radicals:0 "Compromise With The Radicals"
MEX_Compromise_With_The_Radicals_desc:0 "Cardenas may be regarded as a moderate in the Mexican political spectrum, but he is widely seen as a radical in outside circles, and does consider that some Callecistas and Zapatistas have a point.

MEX_Improve_Native_Conditions:0 "Improve Native Conditions"
MEX_Improve_Native_Conditions_desc:0 "We will not forget about our precursors on Mexican soil, the indigenous peoples. Their lot was very bad historically, but starting now, this will change. We will undo the mistake of our ancestors and give them the living conditions they so desperately need."

MEX_Found_The_Nacional_Financiera_desc:0 "Who knows how many development projects are lost due to insufficient financing, or how many poor villages can't share the benefits of our system?

MEX_A_New_Mexico:0 "A New Mexico"
MEX_A_New_Mexico_desc:0 "With the toppling of the Zapatist regime, the fire of Mexican socialism has been put out for now. To make sure it remains that way, the Army, along with their allies the Sinarquistas, will take power until Mexico is deemed ready for a responsible government once again."

MEX_Purging_The_Reds_desc:0 "The first step towards securing our rule over Mexico is to scour the last remnants of Zapatism from it.

MEX_Dissolve_The_Ejidos:0 "Dissolve The Ejidos"
MEX_Dissolve_The_Ejidos_desc:0 "The Ejidos are one of the last remnants of Zapatism still present. Altough admirable in scope, we can't deny that they have been established improperly. It is time to start assessing the land and gradually return it to its legal owner, the haciendros."

MEX_Privatisation:0 "Privatisation"
MEX_Privatisation_desc:0 "The second step of de-Socialisation would be the slow shedding of unnecessary enterprises by the State and placing the cruft under private ownership. This will save us a lot of money, due to no longer having to mantain the country's economy by ourselves."
MEX_Foreign_Investment:0 "Encourage Foreign Investment"
MEX_Foreign_Investment_desc:0 "Before the Revolution, Mexico was shaping up to be a very profitable place to invest in, before the syndicalists drove the investors out.

MEX_Great_Ranches:0 "Great Ranches"
MEX_Great_Ranches_desc:0 "Historically, the great ranches of Mexico formed the backbone of its agriculture. However, the age of great landholders doesn't seem to be returning too soon, so we will work out a compromise: return the land, but introduce reforms so that it can be used more efficiently."
MEX_Promote_Traditonal_Values:0 "Promote Traditional Values"
MEX_Promote_Traditonal_Values_desc:0 "It is through a return to the traditional Mexican values that we will quash the last remnants of the Syndicalist revolution. A return to those will lead to internal peace, which will surely lead to economic growth."

MEX_Restore_The_Monarchy:0 "Restore The Monarchy"
MEX_Restore_The_Monarchy_desc:0 "Mexico has been a monarchy twice in its history, and a republic the rest of the time. However, perhaps the national renewal needed after the Syndical Interregnum has soured the perception of a republic too much.

MEX_The_New_Aristocracy:0 "The New Aristocracy"
MEX_The_New_Aristocracy_desc:0 "What is a monarchy without a peerage to go along with it? We will hand out some fancy titles and quell whatever opposition to a monarchical restoration still remains among the higher-ups.

MEX_Sinarquist_Coup:0 "Sinarquist Coup"
MEX_Sinarquist_Coup_desc:0 "Republics, syndicalists, monarchies, juntas? No! Mexico has had its fair share of everything, and every time it turned out poorly.

MEX_Establish_The_Goldshirts_desc:0 "To make sure that internal dissent is quelled until we manage to fully establish Synarchism, we will create a paramilitary force to help the Policia Nacional establish order in this unstable land.

MEX_Deals_With_Capitalists:0 "Deals With Capitalists"
MEX_Deals_With_Capitalists_desc:0 "While the Capitalist system does not fit entirely within Synarchism, we will still negotiate with them, and allow free and private enterprise to an extent, to foster innovation and competition within a Synarchist framework. We understand that small enterprises are the lifeblood of many communities, and we will not infringe on that principle of life."
MEX_Nationalise_Industry:0 "Nationalise Industry"

MEX_Sinarquist_Youth:0 "Establish The Juventudes Sinarquistas"
MEX_Sinarquist_Youth_desc:0 "The next generations of Mexican youth need to be properly taught the value of the Synarchist system of governance. By establishing our youth organisation and giving it an important role in society, we will make sure that what we have built today will not be toppled tomorrow by a few young dissenters."
MEX_University:0 "Papal University"
MEX_University_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has a long tradition of education. With its persecution ended, we have commenced negotiations with the Holy Father to open a Catholic University in our nation. An educated populace will help make Mexico into the regional power it was always supposed to be."
MEX_Economic_Reforms:0 "Economic Reforms"
MEX_Economic_Reforms_desc:0 "Our shaky economy has been lucky to not be part of the current worldwide crash; but nevertheless, the event made us realise how much reforming it is needed. Who knows if we'll be so lucky next time?"
MEX_Invest_In_Industry:0 "Invest In Industry"
MEX_Invest_In_Industry_desc:0 "Mexico is an agrarian nation, but in this day and age, one cannot rely only on this status to survive. We need to jumpstart our industry now, and some extra funding from whatever we can spare will do the trick."
MEX_Economic_Plan:0 "Economic Plan"
MEX_Economic_Plan_desc:0 "With our economy in a slightly better situation, it is time to think about a larger-scale plan to drive our development onwards. Two proposals have reached our desk, and await our consideration. Which one shall we pick?"
MEX_Plan_Hope:0 "Plan 'Hope'"
MEX_Plan_Hope_desc:0 "The Plan 'Hope' focuses on civilian industry, rural development and infrastructure. Out of the two plans, this will take less to finish, but it might not be that efficient in wartime. However, this plan is ideal for the peaceful nation that we are."
MEX_Develop_Infastructure:0 "Develop Infrastructure"
MEX_Develop_Infastructure_desc:0 "In order to foster economic growth under the terms of the 'Hope' plan, we have to begin improving infrastructure all around Mexico, to create jobs for its people. We will benefit from this not only now, but in the future as well."
MEX_Expand_Power_Plants:0 "Expand Power Plants"
MEX_Expand_Power_Plants_desc:0 "Every house in Mexico deserves the benefits of the new century, and this involves improving access to electricity. We will increase our capacity by expanding the power plants in our country, and by increasing technical school funds so that we can have the engineers needed to man them as well."
MEX_Rural_Development_Program:0 "Rural Development programme"
MEX_Rural_Development_Program_desc:0 "The countryside of Mexico can look either relatively modern or directly taken from a description of the early 19th century. Through the 'Hope' plan's rural development plan, we will alleviate these discrepancies and even out the Mexican countryside's development level."
MEX_Civilian_Sector:0 "Expand Civilian Sector"
MEX_Civilian_Sector_desc:0 "The 'Hope' plan stipulates that our civilian industry sector must be further developed, in order to diversify and solidify our economy. This expansion will be subdivided into three stages, and the first stage shall begin now."
MEX_Continue_Civilian_Expansion:0 "Continue Civilian Expansion"
MEX_Continue_Civilian_Expansion_desc:0 "After the first stage's success, the second stage of the industrial expansion of Plan 'Hope' will begin now."
MEX_Finish_Civillian_Expansion:0 "Finish Civilian Expansion"
MEX_Finish_Civillian_Expansion_desc:0 "With the first and second stages completed according to plan, it is time for the third and final stage of the industry expansion of Plan 'Hope'."
MEX_Reduce_Import_Tarrifs:0 "Reduce Import Tariffs"
MEX_Reduce_Import_Tarrifs_desc:0 "The final stage of the plan involves the reduction of import tariffs, so as to allow foreign, more advanced trade goods and technology into our country more easily. Not only will our trade benefit from this decision, but our native industry will as well in the long run."
MEX_End_Of_Plan_Hope:0 "End Of Plan 'Hope'"
MEX_End_Of_Plan_Hope_desc:0 "The 'Hope' plan has been brought to completion, and Mexico's economy has been strenghtened. Now, if another crisis comes and manages to hit our shores, we will weather it far more easily than we would have before the plan."
MEX_Plan_Unity:0 "Plan 'Unity'"
MEX_Plan_Unity_desc:0 "The 'Unity' plan focuses on heavy industry, with a military slant. An excellent idea in case the Leadership decides we should ready ourselves for war."
MEX_New_Dockyards:0 "New Dockyards"
MEX_New_Dockyards_desc:0 "The Mexican Navy is small, unfitting of a nation as large as us that has access to two oceans. However, the 'Unity' plan includes provisions for dockyard expansion, so as to finally have a navy worthy of our size and status."
MEX_Protective_Tarrifs:0 "Protective Tariffs"
MEX_Protective_Tarrifs_desc:0 "Our economy is in a vulnerable status right now, and introducing protective tarrifs now will help foster native manufacturers. We may rethink these in the future, but for now it is more than necessary."
MEX_Heavy_Industry:0 "Heavy Industry"
MEX_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "The linchpin of the 'Unity' Plan is heavy military industry. Again, the expansion of Mexico's industry to deal with our possible army expansion will be done in three stages. One signature, and Stage I will begin."
MEX_Continue_Industrial_Expansion:0 "Continue Industrial Expansion"
MEX_Continue_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "Stage I is complete, and the Mexican Army rejoices. It is time to start Stage II, and increase the pace of our military modernisation, as well as that of civilian development."
MEX_Finish_Industrial_Expansion:0 "Finish Industrial Expansion"
MEX_Finish_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "With the first two stages done, it is time to finish the 'Unity' industrial expansion. The civilians are happy thanks to the influx of jobs, and the army is happy due to the new equipment coming in at a faster rate. A signature, and the world will be ours."
MEX_End_Of_Plan_Unity:0 "End Of Plan 'Unity'"
MEX_End_Of_Plan_Unity_desc:0 "With the provisions of Plan 'Unity' having been fulfilled, it is time to declare it finished. A new Mexico has risen out of it, one stronger and readier to assume its rightful position of overlord of Central America."
MEX_Military_Reforms:0 "Military Reforms"
MEX_Military_Reforms_desc:0 "The Mexican Army is in dire need of modernisation, and recent events have shown us that reforming it is of the utmost importance, with a global conflict gradually emerging on the horizon. If we are to rise up to our potential, we should begin this process as soon as possible."
MEX_Invest_In_Infantry:0 "Invest in Infantry"
MEX_Invest_In_Infantry_desc:0 "The humble infantryman has been the backbone of any army since the dawn of history. It is only logical that the infantry should be the linchpin of our army reform."
MEX_Modernise_The_High_Command:0 "Modernise the High Command"
MEX_Modernise_The_High_Command_desc:0 "Any modernisation of our foot troops is worthless without a modern High Command to go along with it. Unfortunately, the Army High Command is still stuck in the ways of the past, which certainly will not suffice for the modern day. We must ponder what is to be done with them."
MEX_Purge_The_High_Command:0 "Purge the High Command"
MEX_Purge_The_High_Command_desc:0 "The simplest and bloodiest solution; marginalise or liquidate all those unwilling to accept the truth of modern-day warfare! This may put us at a temporary command disadvantage due to the loss of brainpower, but in the end, we will be truly renewed thanks to this move."
MEX_Reform_The_High_Command:0 "Reform the High Command"
MEX_Reform_The_High_Command_desc:0 "The more time-consuming, but peaceful solution to our High Command problem would be to gradually reform all aspects of it. This way, we will not lose too many great, if old-fashioned brains, but it will take more time until we see a new generation of commanders arise."
MEX_New_Weapons:0 "New Weapons"
MEX_New_Weapons_desc:0 "A soldier is nothing without his rifle, however our ageing designs can be taken as proof that this adage may not apply. However, this need not be the case; we will hold a few weapon trials as well as looking into ways of producing General Mondragon's innovative rifle at home, with the necessary modernisations of course."
MEX_Specialize_The_Factories:0 "Specialise the Factories"
MEX_Specialize_The_Factories_desc:0 "We cannot just produce tank treads in any factory, nor can we just tell a factory that has been up to this point producing knives to start making rifle buttstocks. We will specialise our arms production facilities, so that every component of the Ejercito Federal's armaments has its own production centre."
MEX_Infantry_Is_Our_Backbone:0 "Infantry Is Our Backbone"
MEX_Infantry_Is_Our_Backbone_desc:0 "Our army reforms have increased our infantry's capability by a significant margin. Soon enough, nothing will stop our advance!"
MEX_Reform_the_Cavalry:0 "Reform the Cavalry"
MEX_Reform_the_Cavalry_desc:0 "Pancho Villa's cavalry forces, while not led as effectively as claimed, have shown us that cavalry still has a future in the warfare of tomorrow. With some investment and some doctrinal changes, we may make our army one of the most mobile on the continent."
MEX_Mobile_Doctrine:0 "Mobile Doctrine"
MEX_Mobile_Doctrine_desc:0 "We will examine the mobile tactics used by the revolutionary forces, and examine their applicability into a more regular form of warfare."
MEX_Foriegn_Armor_Specialists:0 "Foreign Armour Specialists"
MEX_Foriegn_Armor_Specialists_desc:0 "As much as we would like to be experts at using mobile forces, the reality is that Mexico lacks the proper history of it. We will solve this problem by inviting foreign experts, to properly advise us in the development of armoured warfare."
MEX_Military_Science:0 "Military Science"
MEX_Military_Science_desc:0 "War is not just a pell-mell struggle between nations, was is a science in itself, fostering great thinkers and great innovations. By exploiting this aspect of war, our research sector will benefit in peacetime as well."
MEX_Naval_Reforms:0 "Naval Reforms"
MEX_Naval_Reforms_desc:0 "For a nation whose coastline stretches as much as ours and has access to two oceans, our navy is pitifully small. We should take steps to remedy this problem."
MEX_New_Shipyards:0 "New Shipyards"
MEX_New_Shipyards_desc:0 "To have a navy fit for protecting our coastline, we have to take the logical step of expanding our shipyards, to host our growing fleet and to have the facilities necessary to rebuild it if it suffers any damage."
MEX_Submarine_Reasearch:0 "Submarine Research"
MEX_Submarine_Reasearch_desc:0 "In order to properly staff our large coast, we have to sacrifice our ambitions of a large, high-seas fleet and instead embrace the nimble submarine and smaller ships. A small sacrifice, but the payoff will be grand."
MEX_Convoy_Hunting_Doctrine:0 "Convoy Hunting"
MEX_Convoy_Hunting_Doctrine_desc:0 "Now that we have properly embraced submarines as our main fleet component, it is time to properly implement the theory necessary to properly make use of them. Our mastery of the depths will make any enemy think twice before defiling our waters."
MEX_Screen_Ships_Research:0 "Screen Ships Research"
MEX_Screen_Ships_Research_desc:0 "Mexico needs a proper naval fleet-in-being; not only just to guard its coasts, but also to provide offshore support and to strike fear in its foes. A large navy however costs a lot, so we should start out small by beginning to work on the fleet's screening ships."
MEX_Large_Fleet_Doctrine:0 "A Large Fleet"
MEX_Large_Fleet_Doctrine_desc:0 "With the screens now in place, it is time for the true jewels of the Mexican Navy to be built. Soon enough, we will be the terror of the Caribbean and of the Northeast Pacific!"
MEX_Naval_Doctrine:0 "Naval Doctrine"
MEX_Naval_Doctrine_desc:0 "We have achieved our naval goals, however naval doctrine is ever-evolving, and in order to stay on our current place, we have to keep evolving as well."
MEX_Mexican_Air_Force:0 "Mexican Air Force"
MEX_Mexican_Air_Force_desc:0 "The Mexican Air Force, instead of being a source of pride for our nation, is a painful humiliation in its current state. We have to start looking into new aerial warfare theories and methods, and quick, before we are hopelessly left behind."
MEX_Modernise_The_Airforce:0 "Modernise the Air force"
MEX_Modernise_The_Airforce_desc:0 "Just as we modernised the rest of our army, so shall we modernise our air force. Our experts will tour the world and learn everything they can about the new advances in aeronautics and plane design. Soon enough, no enemy will challenge us on the aerial front."
MEX_Fighter_Focus:0 "Fighter Focus"
MEX_Fighter_Focus_desc:0 "The aerial war will be won by mantaining air superiority at all costs, protecting our land and sea troops like an umbrella and keeping enemy bombers from reaching our borders. Our research should reflect that and focus on perfecting fighter aircraft design."
MEX_Bomber_Focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
MEX_Bomber_Focus_desc:0 "The aerial war will be won by devastating the enemy's industry and cities, crippling his capacity to produce adequate equipment for his army, leaving it hopeless against our main force's wrath. Our research should reflect this accordingly and focus on bomber aircraft design."
MEX_Reorganize_The_North:0 "Reorganise the North"
MEX_Reorganize_The_North_desc:0 "Much has changed in the Old North since we have left in 1848. People, cities, infrastructure, everything. However, reintegrating the North this will surely be no challenge for multicultural Mexico."
MEX_Hollywood:0 "The Hollywood Question"
MEX_Hollywood_desc:0 "The heart of the film industry of the gringos has now come under our control, and as part of our larger reorganisation of the old Norte, we have to decide what to do with it."
MEX_Alamo:0 "The Alamo Question"
MEX_Alamo_desc:0 "With Tejas the old Alamo has returned in our hands. For us, a symbol of humiliation and treason; for the Anglo-Texans, a symbol of freedom. The question still stands, however; do we leave it be, or do we take it down?"
MEX_Natives:0 "Status of the Natives"
MEX_Natives_desc:0 "The retaken territories do contain a lot of Native Americans, some of whom are resentful of being under yet another foreign country, some of whom are thankful we have liberated them. We, however, still aren't sure how to properly deal with them."
MEX_Women:0 "Status of Northern Women"
MEX_Women_desc:0 "Before the Reconquista, we probably would've described Gringo women as freer than us, but now that we have returned, we see that the situation is totally different. Vast reforms are needed to improve their status, but what exactly should be done?"
MEX_Religion:0 "Status of Northern Religion"
MEX_Religion_desc:0 "As with so many other Northern cultural elements that have come into question following the Reconquista, the Northern religion has now come to the forefront. And, as per the course, the question remains what to do with it. One wrong decision, and we might have given the gringos another reason to possibly take up arms against us."
MEX_Language:0 "Language Question"
MEX_Language_desc:0 "Mexico may be a multicultural nation, however the fact remains that the New Northerners speak in a language that is distant from our own, and as such are mostly free to conspire against us. Some hardliners claim we should introduce harsher sanctions on the English language, however critics claim it will turn them against us. What will we do?"
MEX_Secret_Police:0 "Establish Secret Police"
MEX_Secret_Police_desc:0 "In order to quell the Anglo Rebellion, the Intelligence Ministry has proposed the establishment of a secret police, to disrupt their activities and break up their cells. Such an agency will not only turn the rebellion's tide, but it will also give any other internal subverters pause."
MEX_Vigilantees:0 "Recruit Vigilantes"
MEX_Vigilantees_desc:0 "Perhaps the solution to end the Anglo Rebellion is not establishing a secret police after all. We have received an alternate proposal; namely, recruit pro-regime Hispanic Texans, Natives or just about anyone into vigilante gangs, in order to fight the rebels with their own weaponry."
MEX_End_The_Rebellion:0 "End the Rebellion"
MEX_End_The_Rebellion_desc:0 "We have taken the necessary measures, and the tide of the rebellion has been turned. It is time to end this uprising once and for all."
MEX_Looking_Outwards:0 "Looking Outwards"
MEX_Looking_Outwards_desc:0 "With out internal troubles dealt with and our economy improving, it is time to properly take a look at Mexico's status in the world and ways to improve it."
MEX_Reconquista:0 "Reconquista"
MEX_Reconquista_desc:0 "With America embroiled in a devastating civil war, perhaps the time has come to avenge the loss of the Northern Territories in the 1848 War. We will bleed the Federales dry and perhaps even contribute to the victory of Syndicalism in our northern neighbour."
MEX_California:0 "Retake California"
MEX_California_desc:0 "With parts of the North secured, it is time for the second stage of the Reconquista; retake the true jewel of the West Coast, California. We will not be stopped from reclaiming our destiny! Viva Mexico!"
MEX_Socialism_In_The_Carribean:0 "Socialism In The Caribbean"
MEX_Socialism_In_The_Carribean_desc:0 "Our development hardly matters considering the fact that the Western Sea is under capitalist control. Yet with some funding to our intelligence agencies and some weapons convoys, we might spread the Revolution to the Caribbean as well, and free up our trade."
MEX_Join_The_Internationale:0 "Join The Internationale"
MEX_Join_The_Internationale_desc:0 "We cannot stand on our own against the counter-revolutionary threat on the continent. It is only logical we should join our forces with the Third Internationale."
MEX_Intervention_In_Central_America:0 "Intervention In Central America"
MEX_Intervention_In_Central_America_desc:0 "Mexico hasn't cast off the shackles of Spanish rule only to chain itself again to an European power! No, we will create our own pact with the Centroamericans and bend knee to no foreign power ever again."
