This morning, as he was about to attend a meeting with local syndicalists in the Zócalo square, president Emiliano Zapata was stabbed in the head with an ice-pick by an unknown assailant!

Meanwhile, Zapata was rushed to a nearby hospital, where a battle between life and death ensues..."

mexico.2.t:0 "Zapata is dead!"
mexico.2.d:0 "This morning, the Hero of the Revolution and President of Mexico, Emiliano Zapata, passed away from the injuries he sustained after a terrorist attack in Mexico City.

mexico.7.c:0 "Arrest Calles and all those involved in this conspiracy!"
mexico.8.t:0 "Presidential Elections, 1936"

The many factions of the hegemonic Party of the Mexican Revolution (PRM), from the mainstream Villistas and Zapatistas to the anarchist Magonistas, the Social-Democrats and even the fringe Totalists, have all fielded their own candidates.

mexico.9.d:0 "In 1848, as a result of our defeat in the Mexican-American War, we were forced to cede nearly half of our territory to the United States as per the provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The reversion of this treaty has been a dream for the Mexican people since then. Now, with the USA at war, this could be our chance to regain our lost lands and reassert Mexican control north of the Rio Grande, from California all the way to Texas!"
mexico.9.a:0 "Demand the return of our territories"
mexico.9.b:0 "We can't afford direct conflict, just stake our claims"
mexico.9.c:0 "Are you mad? This is too dangerous!"
mexico.10.t:0 "Mexican territorial demands"
mexico.10.d:0 "Mexico has decided to use the ongoing American Civil War as an opportunity to reclaim the territories they lost to us due to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo! How should we react?"

mexico.11.b:0 "We are not ready for war"
mexico.12.t:0 "The second Mexican-American War"
mexico.12.d:0 "Our refusal to accept the Mexican territorial claims was the last straw. They decided to declare war upon us in order to try to gain those disputed territories by force. Now, troops of the National Guard, together with volunteers from local population, are being mobilised to repel the Mexican assaults!"
mexico.12.a:0 "They must be stopped!"
mexico.13.t:0 "Mexicans occupy the south west"
mexico.13.d:0 "How could this happen?! The Mexican Army has crossed the entire south and is now occupying all state capitals. Maybe this is our last chance to attempt to end this damn war..."
mexico.13.a:0 "Offer peace treaty, recognise Mexican territorial gains"
mexico.13.b:0 "No, the war will continue until we march through Mexico City!"
mexico.16.d:0 "What a disaster! A good portion of the Southwestern USA has been lost to the advancing Mexican Army. With their troops threatening to advance even deeper, this is the time to accept our defeat and cede them the disputed territory."

mexico.16.b:0 "No compromise until we are marching on their capital"
mexico.17.t:0 "We're losing the Mexican-American War"
mexico.17.d:0 "The American resistance is being tougher than we thought. Not only we did not achieve any of our major goals so far, but the American army has advanced across the Rio Grande, occupying important cities in the border. We must accept our defeat..."
mexico.17.a:0 "Accept our defeat, propose a peace settlement"
mexico.17.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Washington"
mexico.18.t:0 "A peace offer from Mexico"
mexico.18.d:0 "Our brave Army and National Guardsmen, supplemented with volunteers from local population, successfully repelled the Mexican assault. Now the humiliated Mexican leadership offers us cease fire, in which they promise to withdrawn all their troops from US soil. How shall we react?"
mexico.18.a:0 "Yes, accept their proposal"
mexico.18.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City"
mexico.19.t:0 "The Treaty of Tangamandapio"
mexico.19.d:0 "The Americans have accepted our peace offer. Now we must withdrawn from US soil and relinquish all our territorial claims..."
mexico.19.a:0 "¡Oh! Y ahora, ¿Quién podrá defendernos?"
mexico.20.t:0 "Longists occupy parts of the disputed territory"
mexico.20.d:0 "The ongoing American Civil War, together with our direct intervention against the Federal Government, has allowed the Longist rebels to seize parts of our rightful lands, such as eastern Tejas! How shall we deal with this violation of our territorial integrity?"
mexico.20.a:0 "Demand their immediate withdrawal from disputed territory!"
mexico.20.b:0 "It is too risky"
mexico.21.t:0 "Mexico demands our withdrawal from Texas"
mexico.21.d:0 "During our ongoing assault, we have managed to capture parts of the state of Texas, which is claimed by Mexico as well. They have issued an official diplomatic demand for our immediate withdrawal from disputed territory. What shall we do?"
mexico.21.a:0 "We must accept their demands, we can't afford another front"
mexico.21.b:0 "Never, Texas will never be Mexican!"
mexico.22.t:0 "American Union state refuses our demands"
mexico.22.d:0 "The foolish leadership of the American Union state refused to withdrawn their troops from our rightful territory. What shall we do?"
mexico.22.a:0 "War will solve this!"
mexico.22.b:0 "t is too risky...."
mexico.23.t:0 "We're losing the war against the Longists"
mexico.23.d:0 "The American Union State resistance is being tougher than we thought. Not only we did not achieve any of our major goals so far, but the Longist army has advanced across the Rio Grande, occupying important cities in the border. We must accept our defeat and withdraw from Tejas and other areas of the Deep South."
mexico.23.a:0 "Accept our defeat, propose a peace settlement"
mexico.23.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Atlanta"
mexico.24.t:0 "A peace offer from Mexico"
mexico.24.d:0 "Our brave forces have successfully repelled the Mexican assault. Now the humiliated Mexican leadership offers us cease fire, in which they promise to withdrawn all their troops from AUS soil. How shall we react?"
mexico.24.a:0 "Yes, accept their proposal"
mexico.24.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City"
mexico.25.t:0 "We're losing the war against Mexico"
mexico.25.d:0 "The Mexican Army is much tougher than we thought. Not only we did not achieve any of our major goals so far, but their army has advanced across the Deep South, occupying important American cities. We must accept our defeat and withdraw from Texas."

mexico.25.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City"

mexico.26.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Atlanta"
mexico.27.t:0 "Lost territories back under our control"
mexico.27.d:0 "The Americans have accepted our demands and several territories lost in the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo are now back under our control! These territories, however, are not uninhabited wastelands as they used to be back in 1848: a large and well-armed Anglo population in these states will pose a great threat to the rule of our government and occupying forces."
mexico.27.a:0 "Well, I wasn't expecting that..."
mexico.28.t:0 "War against the Pacific States?"
mexico.28.d:0 "Another rebel faction of the American Civil War, the Pacific States of America, currently control an area composed of the western seaboard - this includes our rightful territories of Alta California. We should attack them immediately!"
mexico.28.a:0 "Attack!"
mexico.28.b:0 "We are tired of conflict already"
mexico.29.t:0 "Victory over the Pacific States"
mexico.29.d:0 "The Mexican army has overcome the armies of the Pacific States of America and are now in a position to demand terms. Some in the government want the whole of California to be returned to Mexico but others feel that aggressive demands will lead to another possible war in the future."
mexico.29.a:0 "Demand all of California"
mexico.29.b:0 "Demand the southern half of California"
mexico.29.c:0 "Continue the Offensive, the Pacific coast shall be ours"
mexico.30.t:0 "Mexico demands all of California"
mexico.30.d:0 "We have been beaten by Mexico in the war and they have demanded Arizona and all of California. The people want to keep resisting but there may be no options left..."
mexico.30.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
mexico.30.b:0 "No deal, we fight to the end"
mexico.31.t:0 "Mexico demands Southern California"
mexico.31.d:0 "We have been beaten by Mexico in the war and they have demanded Arizona and Southern California. The people want to keep resisting but there may be no options left."
mexico.31.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept"
mexico.31.b:0 "No deal, fight to the end"
mexico.32.t:0 "The PSA accepts Our Demands"
mexico.32.d:0 "The PSA has seen the wisdom of accepting our demands and we can now look forward to having California back. This is a great day for Mexico."
mexico.32.a:0 "Excellent"
mexico.33.t:0 "The PSA refuses our demands"
mexico.33.d:0 "The PSA has refused to accept our demands and now we must destroy them."
mexico.33.a:0 "Bastards"
mexico.34.t:0 "PSA troops occupy Baja California"
mexico.34.d:0 "Troops of the Pacific States have occupied the Baja California peninsula of Mexico! With our troops about to advance deeper into Mexico, maybe this is the perfect opportunity for press claims for a peace settlement to our advantage."
mexico.34.a:0 "Send the envoys"
mexico.34.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Mexico City"
mexico.35.t:0 "Peace proposal from the Pacific States"
mexico.35.d:0 "Troops of the Pacific States have occupied the Baja California peninsula of Mexico! With their troops about to advance deeper into Mexico, they have seized the opportunity and sent their envoys to negotiate a peace settlement that is most advantageous to them. Should we accept their claims to Baja California and end the conflict?"
mexico.35.a:0 "Accept their offer"
mexico.35.b:0 "No peace until we're marching on Sacramento"
mexico.35.c:0 "Continue the war, we will crush the PSA"
mexico.36.t:0 "Old and new dynasties"
mexico.36.d:0 "As our government has decided to restore the Mexican monarchy, now we must decide which dynasty shall ascend to the throne. Should we invite Doña María Anna Tunkl-Iturbide, of the House of Habsburg-Itúrbide? Since she is, famously, granddaughter of Salvador de Itúrbide (grandson of our first emperor Agustín and an adopted son of our second monarch Maximilian I), she would be most appreciated by the traditional Catholics, conservative politicians and would put us on good relations with the European powers. On the other hand, a 'nativist' clique has emerged, supporting the claims of Don Fernando de Teruel, current holder of the Spanish title of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo - thus, a descendent of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II."
mexico.36.a:0 "Support the claims of Doña María Anna de Habsburgo-Itúrbide"
mexico.36.b:0 "Choose Don Fernando, the Duke of Moctezuma"
mexico.37.t:0 "The Sinarquistas Attack!"
mexico.37.d:0 "The top leadership of the Unión Nacional Sinarquista are at this moment attempting a coup against our government! Hundreds of their Goldshirt militias have surrounded the Palacio Nacional, while rumour has it that army troops sympathetic to their cause are rushing towards Mexico City. They demand the surrender of the current cabinet and their replacement by their own party!"
mexico.37.a:0 "The Sinarquistas succeed and establish a new government"
mexico.38.t:0 "The Anglo Rebellion"
mexico.38.d:0 "The vast majority of the population in our new northern states are English speaking "Anglos" who are resisting our rule. They are well armed and many fear that they will try to rebel against us."
mexico.38.a:0 "The Gringos will learn to accept our rule" 
mexico.39.t:0 "Gringo Riots!"
mexico.39.d:0 "The Anglo population in our occupied territories have staged a number of protests, ranging from peaceful gatherings and illegal parades to major protests and acts of vandalism. Obviously, it will take a really, really long time until these gringos accept our rightful rule over Tejas, Nuevo Mexico and Alta California…"
mexico.39.a:0 "Riots occur in major cities"
mexico.40.t:0 "Actions of the Anglo resistance"
mexico.40.d:0 "The resistance of the Anglo population against our occupation forces continues. Once again, terrorist groups operating within the Northern territories have staged a number of attacks aimed on crippling our infrastructure, our industrial output and the morale of our forces."
mexico.40.a:0 "Saboteurs bomb a number of important factories"
mexico.40.b:0 "Guerrilleros sabotage our transport infrastructure"
mexico.40.c:0 "Guerrilleros stage organised hit-and-run raids against our troops"
mexico.41.t:0 "Major Anglo Offensive!"
mexico.41.d:0 "We are under attack! Leaders of the Anglo resistance in the North have launched a major coordinated uprising against our troops!"
mexico.41.a:0 "¡Oh! Y ahora, ¿Quién podrá defenderme?"
mexico.42.t:0 "Attack by Anglo guerrillas!"
mexico.42.d:0 "The Anglo insurrectionists in the North have launched a full-on assault against our occupation forces!"
mexico.42.a:0 "Damn them!"
mexico.45.t:0 "The anti-clerical policies of Mexico"
mexico.45.d:0 "Our president is a known militant atheist and an opponent of the Catholic Church. Over the past months, he and his close advisors have begun to move to enforce the anti-clerical articles of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 — including provisions such as depriving the Church of its property rights and depriving the clergy of a number of civil liberties. "
mexico.45.a:0 "Yes, begin persecution of the Catholic Church"
mexico.46.t:0 "Catholic unrest"
mexico.46.d:0 "The Catholics in our country are not reacting well to our persecution of their church, and they are beginning to rebel against us. Should the persecution continue?"
mexico.46.a:0 "Keep up the anti-clerical campaign"
mexico.46.b:0 "They already had enough, suspend further persecution"
mexico.47.t:0 "The Cristero Uprising begins"
mexico.47.d:0 "The anti-Catholic persecution of our president has caused a number of rebellions in Central Mexico. Local peasants, aided by conservative politicians and the remainders of the Catholic hierarchy, have taken up arms! Rallying under the banner of the Cristo Rey and Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, these bandits have pledged to defend their right to practice their faith!"
mexico.47.a:0 "To arms!"
mexico.48.t:0 "Catholic uprising in Mexico"
mexico.48.d:0 "The anti-Catholic persecution undertaken by Mexico's socialist president has reached such outrageous results that tens of thousands of peasants have taken up arms against the government! Aided by the remnants of the old elites and local priests, these rebels are rallying under the banners of El Cristo Rey and Nuestra Señora de Guadaloupe and pledged to defend their faith! Some members of our foreign service have proposed that we send supplies and volunteers to help this rebellion."
mexico.48.a:0 "Support them, send supplies and volunteers"
mexico.48.b:0 "We should not get involved"
mexico.49.t:0 "Italian involvement in La Cristiada"
mexico.49.d:0 "The Papist government of Italy has lent their support to the Catholic uprising in Central Mexico. Hundreds of their military advisors and a good cache of arms have arrived to the rebel-held lands. We can't tolerate their meddling in our internal affairs!"
mexico.49.a:0 "Damn them!"
mexico.50.t:0 "The end of the Cristero Uprising"
mexico.50.d:0 "The Mexican Army, after a tough fight, has managed to defeat the Cristero Uprising, also known as La Cristiada. At last, Mexico is free from the perfidious influence of the Catholic Church! We can now continue our reforms and keep up with our project of transforming the country into a respected atheist republic."
mexico.50.a:0 "At last, establish official state atheism"
mexico.51.t:0 "Calles Embraces Totalism"
mexico.51.d:0 "After his return flight from the Union of Britain there are rumours that he is working on a new project to reform the Partido and advance his brand of Totalism here in Mexico..."
mexico.51.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn't come to that"
mexico.52.t:0 "Fate of Hollywood"
mexico.52.d:0 "With Alta California finally ours again, we need to decide what to do with its film industry, once a pillar of U.S. capitalist propaganda. The Comité is divided between leaving them be (barring our new film censorship and approval board), expropriation, and purging the area to build something far more useful for el pueblo. While industrialising the studios would boost California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our new citizens Norteños will be upset…"
mexico.52.a:0 "Leave them alone, remember they helped finance los Villistas"
mexico.52.b:0 "Consolidate the studios under government control"
mexico.52.c:0 "Hollywood belongs to its workers!"
mexico.52.e:0 "Purge the studios and build heavy industry!"
mexico.53.t:0 "The Mexican Question"
mexico.53.d:0 "The Mexican army managed to conquer a good part of our western and southwestern states. Despite a well-organised campaign of both non-violent resistance and guerrilla attacks by the Anglo population Mexico continues their occupation and is preparing to fully integrate these territories in the long run. With our Civil War over we now have the opportunity to press Mexico to return us our rightful territories - be it through diplomatic means or through yet another war"
mexico.53.a:0 "Send an envoy and demand the return of our territories"
mexico.53.b:0 "We must face the facts and recognise the new borders"
mexico.54.t:0 "Ultimatum over the Territories"
mexico.54.d:0 "The Mexican army managed to conquer a good part of the western and southwestern American states. Despite a well-organised campaign of both non-violent resistance and guerrilla attacks by the local Anglo population we are determined to continue our occupation. Now with their Civil War over the American government is demanding that we return them these former territories. And according to our intelligence reports they are even considering going to war against Mexico for this! Even if we know that we have a historical right to those lands we must keep in mind that the Americans are much more strong and organised now - it is very possible that in case of war we may not resist their offensive."
mexico.54.a:0 "Accept their demands, we can't hope to win another war"
mexico.54.b:0 "Attempt to divide the disputed territories with them"
mexico.54.c:0 "Let them come, we're ready to defend our land"
mexico.55.t:0 "Mexico accepts our demands"
mexico.55.d:0 "The government of Mexico has folded before our might and accepted our demands. Now the former western and southwestern states are back under American control!"
mexico.55.a:0 "Great!"
mexico.56.t:0 "A proposal from Mexico"
mexico.56.d:0 "The government of Mexico has declined our demands for the return of the occupied American territories. Many in our government demand that we start a campaign of liberation at once! But there's still some hope: Mexico has proposed a partition of the occupied territories. Leaving American citizens at foreign rule may sound outrageous, but as we're still recovering from the civil war, maybe it would be wise to listen to what they have to say."
mexico.56.a:0 "All right, listen to what they have to say"
mexico.56.b:0 "We don't want to listen, return the territories now!"
mexico.57.t:0 "Mexico declines our demands"
mexico.57.d:0 "The government of Mexico has refused to follow our demands and are insisting that the occupied western and southwestern American states are their rightful territory. We must attack them now!"
mexico.57.a:0 "That's it - Ready the troops and attack"
mexico.57.b:0 "We're not ready for war now - Back down"
mexico.58.t:0 "A partition of the Mexican Cession"
mexico.58.d:0 "The Syndies up north have agreed to, at least, listen to our proposal about dividing the disputed territories between our two countries. We could press to keep the oil-rich counties of West Texas, or the arid region around El Paso, or at the very least sparsely-populated southern Arizona - the last territory to be ceded by Mexico to the U.S. in 1853. It is likely that they won't accept any offer that we make, but we must try."
mexico.58.a:0 "Try to keep Southern Arizona, the lands of Venta de La Mesilla"
mexico.58.b:0 "We want the arid Trans-Pecos and Southern Arizona, at least"
mexico.58.c:0 "Try to keep Southern Arizona, the lands of Venta de La Mesilla"
mexico.59.t:0 "The Americans don't want to listen"
mexico.59.d:0 "The Syndies up north have refused our offer to partition the disputed territories!"
mexico.59.a:0 "We must accept their demands, unfortunately"
mexico.59.b:0 "Let them come, we're ready to defend our land"
mexico.60.t:0 "Mexico wants Southern Arizona"
mexico.60.d:0 "The Mexican government has made a proposal to us: despite our threats they still insist on keeping Southern Arizona - the sparsely-populated lands of the Gadsden Purchase the last territory transferred from Mexico to the US back in 1853. Those territories centred on the town of Tucson have a very small population of no more than 40.000 and little to no natural resources - thus accepting Mexican rule over that tiny strip of territory could be a small price to pay to avoid another war. On the other hand, most of our population wouldn't even accept the idea of our government handing territory containing tens of thousands of American nationals to another country!"
mexico.60.a:0 "Accept the Mexican proposal, it's quite reasonable"
mexico.60.b:0 "Refuse, it is rightful American territory"
mexico.61.t:0 "Mexico wants Far-West Texas and Southern Arizona"
mexico.61.d:0 "The stubborn Mexicans have made a proposal to us: despite our threats, they still insist on keeping Southern Arizona (the lands of the Gadsden Purchase, the last territory transferred from Mexico to the US, back in 1853), plus the sparsely populated far-western part of Texas, beyond the Pecos river, centred on El Paso County (the so-called Trans-Pecos zone). Given that those territories are part of the Chihuahan Desert, with a very small population and little to no natural resources, it could be a small price to pay to avoid another war. On the other hand, however, most of our population wouldn't even accept the idea of our government handing territory containing tens of thousands of American nationals to another country!"
mexico.61.a:0 "It's just a desert wasteland, let them keep it"

And, according to our intelligence reports, they are even considering going to war against Mexico for this!

After their attempted ultimatum against American forces attacking our territory has failed, they now have approached our government with an offer for an alliance.

mexico.99.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Territories"
mexico.99.d:0 "National elation over La Reconquista continues in full swing. Unfortunately, overwhelming euphoria is not without its overzealous drawbacks. Recently, certain national activists, civil administrators and other (generally traditionalist) voices have advocated that since the old northern territories have returned to us, we should likewise return the nature of their civil administration along revanchist lines - that is, the former U.S. states should be redrawn to match the pre-1848 borders of Alta California, Nuevo Mexico, Texas, even the Oregon Territory if our new gains allow it. These 'conservatives' argue that such a reorganisation would centralise administration of the old U.S. states and streamline governance over the North while exalting Mexican pride and erasing the estadounidense colonialism over Mexico's ancestral lands. The 'progressive' faction, meanwhile, dismiss these borders as vague even for the time, and further denounce the scheme as archaic, impractical and bound to outrage the Anglos more than ever. Instead, the progressives argue, the established former U.S. State administrations are already functional, well-organised and stable, and therefore should be adopted in full and merely expanded upon. Today, the Comité de Ocupación del Norte is scheduled hold a meeting and to adjourn with a decision on the matter.
mexico.99.a:0 "Conservative: Revert to traditional borders"
mexico.99.b:0 "Progressive: Expand on existing state apparatus"
mexico.100.t:0 "The Fate of the Alamo"
mexico.100.d:0 "It was inevitable that the question of that decaying symbol known as the Alamo would arise. As it stands, the Alamo is a rallying point for insurrectionists and a shrine for the old regime. Therefore, a resolution has been called for to renovate the building and thus repurpose its symbolic value — but again, this may only serve to incur the wrath of the gringos. As per the directive of the Comité de Ocupación del Norte, the Alamo will be…"
mexico.100.a:0 "Preserved as a cultural heritage site"
mexico.100.b:0 "A war dead memorial"
mexico.100.c:0 "Demolished! With urban expansion built over it for good measure!"
mexico.101.t:0 "The Status of American Indians"
mexico.101.d:0 "With a change in government it is only natural that ostracised groups will seek support from the new government in hopes of finally overturning their fortunes. In this case, it is America's first peoples, with which we share a lineage of American nativity and European colonialism. Deprived also of their territory, as well as their sovereignty, Indians now live like zoo animals in reservations, where poverty is rampant, and the Indian Citizenship Act of 1936 does not go far enough in repairing centuries of subjugation. Therefore, we should expand on the act, as it is our moral imperative that we grant assistance to the destitute American Indian and begin lifting them from oppression at last."
mexico.101.a:0 "Yes, we stand alongside the oppressed Indian"
mexico.101.b:0 "Will we ever stop enraging the Americans with all the guns?!"
mexico.102.t:0 "Status of Women in the Territories"
mexico.102.d:0 "Anglo women have taken to the streets in planned demonstrations — not against Mexican occupation, but for women's rights. While generally critical of Mexico's actions, suffragists have decided to make the best of our progressive government and have thus petitioned Mexico to succeed where Washington failed — officially extend Mexico's Constitutional rights of women to the territories."
mexico.102.a:0 "Grant universal rights for all women!"
mexico.102.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
mexico.102.c:0 "Now is not the best time"
mexico.103.t:0 "Status of Religion in the Territories"
mexico.103.d:0 "While Mexico has historically been a Catholic country, the Anglos take on the religious heritage of England, Protestantism. The people in the territories — Texas in particular — are deeply religious, so the Comité has to tread carefully on religious policy. It would be foolish, however, to ignore intelligence reports from our spy service which emphasise how the local churches are condoning, aiding and abetting the insurrectionists, many of whom are zealous Protestants themselves."
mexico.103.a:0 "Enforce Catholicism as the state religion"
mexico.103.b:0 "Enforce anti-clerical laws of 1917 Constitution"
mexico.103.c:0 "Let the Protestants freely go about their business"
mexico.104.t:0 "Status of Language in the Territories"
mexico.104.d:0 "The majority of both the Mexican and Anglo populations do not speak the others' language, which is already causing incidents in the territories. While forcing the entire Anglo population to learn and speak Spanish would be… impractical, perhaps some basic public works could assist our troops and settlers in the North. The principal subject of today's Comité meeting is: From schools and government to restaurants and street signs, what will be the official language in the territories?"
mexico.104.a:0 "Español"
mexico.104.b:0 "Bilingüe / Bilingual"
mexico.104.c:0 "English"
mexico.105.t:0 "The Reintegration of the Mexican Cession"
mexico.105.d:0 "After many years of extensive resettlement, intensive propaganda efforts and numerous crushed uprisings, organised revolt against Mexican governance has largely subsided. While some resistance persists among old militia extremists, Anglos at large have gradually come to terms with our rule and settlers are now a significant minority in the North. With Los Territorios Reconquistados firmly under our control, we've won unhindered access to its resources and industry."
mexico.105.a:0 "Finally!"

MEX_Privatisation_desc:0 "After we decided to follow a free-market approach to our economy, our Ministry of Industry has produced a report on a number of state-owned industries that should be privatised.

MEX_Repeal_Anti_Clericism_desc:0 "Since the signing of the Mexican Constitution of 1917, the Roman Catholic clergy has been deprived of a number of civil rights, such as the right to vote and own property. Not only that, the Church itself was persecuted, with local parishes shut, religious education suppressed, monasteries looted and even traditional religious feasts prohibited. Since our new government has come to power, these persecutions have been much relaxed. However, it is time to officially repeal these anti-clerical articles of our constitution!"

These actions will, of course, help demobilise any existing opposition to our regime but, at the same time, some feel that these extremist measures will do us much harm on the long run.

The First Mexican Empire, proclaimed just after the independence from Spain, lasted under Agustín I from 1821 to 1823. The, the Second Empire, imposed by the occupying French forces of Napoleon III, survived from 1864 to 1867 under the rule of Maximilian I, an Austrian Habsburg archduke. Ever since the Sinarquistas have established their new nationalist regime, some fringe groups have started advocating for the restoration of monarchy in Mexico under a devout Catholic monarch. These groups have slowly gaining more and more support both among the political classes, to the point that on today's session of the Senate, sinarquista senator Manuel Torres Bueno has openly proposed a Third Mexican Empire to be instituted. Of course, most of our population is happy to live under a republic and would strongly oppose this scheme.
