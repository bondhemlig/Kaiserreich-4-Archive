### Event text ###

 ott.1.t:0 "The Eternal State"
 ott.1.d:0 "In the year of 1936, 15 years after the Weltkrieg, the victorious Ottoman Empire was having hard time controlling its Vilayets despite economic boom happened after the war. Sultan Abdulmecid II recently issued ferman that Vilayet rights shall not be infringed, but that does little on disloyal subjects like Albania, Armenia, Oman, and Libya."
 ott.1.a:0 "Calm before the storm..."
 
 ott.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ottoman Empire!"
 ott.2.d:0 "Almost month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shockwaves have reached the Ottoman Empire. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ottoman lira is losing it´s already-low value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our unstable economy is on the verge of collapse....."

 ott.3.a:0 "Let´s hope stabilisation will come soon.."
 
 ott.4.t:0 "Government intervention"
 ott.4.d:0 "With at least partial political stabilisation finally in place, we are prepared to enact a series of intensive reforms, aimed at restoring pre-crisis industrial power."

 ott.5.a:0 "Keep it up!"
 
 ott.6.t:0 "Request of the International Jewish Lobby"
 ott.6.d:0 "The Ottoman authorities have always welcomed the Jews. Since the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, who allowed the settlement of the Iberian Jews in his lands after their expulsion from Spain, they have been an integral part of the empire. However, since the rise of Zionism, laws have been passed to prevent the mass settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine, while avoiding restriction on their pilgrimages. Recently we have been approached by an international Jewish lobby, asking for less constricting laws."
 ott.6.a:0 "Very well, allow limited settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine"
 ott.6.b:0 "Grant complete freedom of settlement to all non-Ottoman Jews"
 ott.6.c:0 "We will not jeopardize the stability of Palestine!"
 
 ott.7.t:0 "Settlers in Palestine"
 ott.7.d:0 "The incredible number of Jews who flocked towards Palestine after the passage of new Settlement Laws caused a drastic demographic change in the region. Since their settlement in Jerusalem and the environs, it has become clear that Hebrew is rapidly becoming the second, and some might even argue first language of Palestine. The ideals of Zionism have also entered our lands, and several Judaic factions have already requested increasing amounts of autonomy, even verging on demands for independence."
 ott.7.a:0 "Our greatness came from centralized government, not giving away power!"
 ott.7.b:0 "Grant them local autonomy"
 
 ott.8.t:0 "The Great Arabian Revolt!"
 ott.8.d:0 "In the middle of 1944, several Arab cities erupted in open revolt. Mobs began burning down Ottoman institutions and raided police and military bases. From Baghdad to Jerusalem, Arabs have risen up against the Ottoman Empire."
 ott.8.a:0 "We will crush them!"
 
 ott.9.t:0 "Second Arabian Revolt!"
 ott.9.d:0 "In the middle of 1946 several Arabian tribes united their efforts to destabilize the Ottoman Empire again. Will it succeed this time?"
 ott.9.a:0 "Haven't they learned their lesson already?"
 
 ott.10.t:0 "Arabian Revolt Crushed"
 ott.10.d:0 "Rejoice! Our invincible armies have beaten the Bedouin rabble!"
 ott.10.a:0 "Biz Alla Bilen!"
 
 ott.11.t:0 "Arabian Revolt is successful!"
 ott.11.d:0 "The Bedouin tribes are defeating our armies and occupying our lands! Shall we offer a peace or keep fighting?"
 ott.11.a:0 "Start the negotiations, we have been beaten..."
 ott.11.b:0 "Keep fighting, for sake of the Devlet-i Aliye-i Osmaniye!"
 
 ott.12.t:0 "The State of Syria"
 ott.12.d:0 "The State of Syria have been created."
 ott.12.a:0 "Ok."
 
 ott.13.t:0 "The State of Iraq"
 ott.13.d:0 "The State of Iraq have been created."
 ott.13.a:0 "Ok."
 
 ott.14.t:0 "Egypt and Arabia expands!"
 ott.14.d:0 "Now that Arabian Revolt is successful, Egypt and Arabia annexes some lands in the Ottoman middle east."
 ott.14.a:0 "Ok."
 
 ott.15.t:0 "Nawruz Riots"
 ott.15.d:0 "There are dissatisfactions at the Kurdish parts of our Empire. The Kurds are demanding larger autonomy, some even wants independence! Riots are out of control in Mosul and we suspect Syndicalists are behind it! However, Kurdish Aghas and Landowners are also supporting this movement so we don't know who is behind this incident.."
 ott.15.a:0 "Ready the Tüfek-i Muhafızayi Osmaniye!"
 
 ott.16.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising!"
 ott.16.d:0 "Kurdish riots grew day by day and Ottoman forces failed the contain it thus now all-out revolt is happening! The Kurdish Militias fortified from Malatya to Iranian border, and now Ottomans are mobilizing more forces in order to crush the rebellion. Could this is be the final blow to sick man of the Europe?"
 ott.16.a:0 "We'll See..."
 
 ott.17.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising!"
 ott.17.d:0 "Newroz riots turned into massive revolt! The Ottoman Rifle Guards did their best but they got overhelmed by Kurdish mobs and tribesmen... Now that Kurds formed their militias and fortified their positions, what shall we do?"
 ott.17.a:0 "Crush the enemies of the Devlet-i Aliye!"
 ott.17.b:0 "We have more issues in our hand. Let them go, for now..."
 
 ott.18.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising crushed!"
 ott.18.d:0 "Rejoice! We have crushed those backstabbing traitors!"
 ott.18.a:0 "Biz Alla Bilen!"
 
 ott.19.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising is successful!"
 ott.19.d:0 "Kurdish militias are holding their ground, and it seems we can't able to reclaim it. What shall we do?"

 ott.19.b:0 "Devlet-i Aliye will never bow to traitors!"
 
 ott.20.t:0 "Kurds leaving to join uprising"
 ott.20.d:0 "The eruption of the Kurdish uprising in the Ottoman Empire convinced part of our Kurdish population to leave the country to join the uprising. Shall we allow them to leave our country to join the uprising?"

 ott.20.b:0 "Prevent them from Leaving."
 
 ott.21.t:0 "Kurdish Volunteers from Persia"
 ott.21.d:0 "Kurdish Volunteers have been arrived from Persia."
 ott.21.a:0 "Ok."
 
 ott.22.t:0 "The Kurdish State"
 ott.22.d:0 "The State of Kurdistan have been created."
 ott.22.a:0 "Ok."
 
 ott.23.t:0 "Elections in Kurdistan"
 ott.23.d:0 "Since the beginning of the struggle for freedom many different parties have claimed that they are the one true ruler of Kurdistan. Four big parties have a chance of Winning, Partiya Karkeren Kurdistan, a Radical Socialistic party. The second party is the Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan, a social conservative party. The third option is the Partiya Azadi, a Social Democratic party! The last choice is the radical Partiya Serbokho, a nationalist party."

 ott.24.t:0 "Kurdistan's Foreign Policy"
 ott.24.d:0 "During the election Partiya Sosyalisti said that if they would win they would seek protection and cooperation from the Internationale, now it is time to decide if we should do so or remain in isolation."
 ott.24.a:0 "Try to join the Internationale!"
 ott.24.b:0 "Isolationism will protect Kurdistan."
 
 ott.25.t:0 "Kurdistan wants to join Internationale"
 ott.25.d:0 "Our Socialist friends in Kurdistan wants to join the Internationale, hoping that membership in our alliance will protect the independence of their newborn state. Although some eager officers are arguing for the immediate acceptance of Kurdistan into the Internationale, the most of them are against such a drastic move, and opt for a simple guarantee of their independence."
 ott.25.a:0 "Invite Kurdistan into the Internationale!"
 ott.25.b:0 "Just guarantee their independence."

 arabia.1.d:0 "Under the control of regional powers such as Egypt and the Ottoman Empire through most of its history, the Kingdom of Hejaz gained political independence in the early 20th century. It was one of several regions of the Ottoman Empire provoked into rebellion by T. E. Lawrence (""of Arabia"") of the British during the Weltkrieg. In 1916 its independence was proclaimed by Hussein bin Ali, the Sharif of Makkah. When the Germans joined the Ottoman forces in 1920, the Arabs and British soldiers were pushed out of Mesopotamia. While the British decided to retreat to the Suez Canal, where they were able to resist against the German forces, the Arab revolters decided to make their stand in the region of Nejd and its capital, Ryad. The Ottoman forces, strained after many years of war, were unable to overcome the Arab fighter and in the end an armistice was signed where the Kingdoms of Nejd and Hejaz were recognized as independent states. However, soon after that Hussein bin Ali was able to gain control over Nejd, annexing it to Hejaz in 1922. Thanks to the protection of Egypt, Hejaz was able to survive until now, but the decline of the Ottoman Empire may lead to another attempt to free the Arabs still living under the Ottoman rule."

 egy.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Egypt"
 egy.1.d:0 "The History of modern Egypt conventionally begins from 1882 when Egypt became part of the British sphere of influence in the region, a situation that conflicted with Egypt's position as part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1914 the Protectorate was made official, and the title of the head of state, which had changed from pasha to khedive in 1867, was changed to sultan, to repudiate the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman sultan, who was backing the Central powers in the Weltkrieg. Abbas II was deposed as khedive and replaced by his uncle, Husayn Kamil, as sultan. Upon his death in 1917, his only son, Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn, declined the succession, and Husayn Kamil's brother Ahmed Fuad ascended the throne as Fuad I. With the signing of the Peace of Honour, Egypt remained under British control. However, Arab nationalism led to violent riots which convinced the British to unilaterally declare Egyptian independence in 1922, abolishing the protectorate and establishing an independent Kingdom of Egypt. Britain retained control of the Canal Zone, Sudan and Egypt's external protection. When the 1925 British Revolution broke out, Egypt occupied Sudan, but was forced to give control over the Suez Canal to Germany. Fuad I, who was seen as a British puppet, was forced to flee and was replaced by its predecessor and nephew Abbas II. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the recent years, Arabs nationalism is on the rise and Egypt decided to organize the first Congress of Arab Nations, which will be held in 1936. Together with Hejaz, they might try to free the Arabs still living under the Ottoman rule."
