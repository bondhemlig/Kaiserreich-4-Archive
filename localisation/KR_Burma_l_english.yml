BRM_totalist_party:0 "Nagani Book Club"
BRM_totalist_party_long:0 "Nagani Book Club\n§gEstablished in the mid 30s, the Red Naga Book Club emerged as one of the eminent political cliques of the Burmese Student movement. It was originally founded by the leftist teacher Than Tun and the former student union president U Nu as a means to promote and distribute Burmese translations of Marxist and Syndicalist literatures. Over time, the book club grew more closely affiliated with militant nationalist groups and at Than Tun’s behest it embraced a more radical political outlook, emphasizing a synthesis between socialism, buddhism and Burmese nationalism, as well as adopting a more organized structure. Nagani has now risen from a mere study group to a well-read and well-armed quasi student militia, with Thakin Than Tun as its commander. It stands as one of the most extreme, as well as most authoritarian factions among the Student Movement.§!"
BRM_totalist_party2:0 "RFP"
BRM_totalist_party_long2:0 "Red Flag Party\n§gIn the wake of the Burmese revolution, many formerly banned and discredited leftist factions have emerged onto the political scene with new, legitimate platforms to spread their ideology through. The Red Naga Book Club is no exception, what once was a study group turned student militia has reorganized itself once more into a closely knit vanguardist party calling for the complete social and economic transformation of Burma into a “Totalist State”. Than Tun is an eager supporter of the Totalist Charter, although he has over time made his own adjustments and additions to the political doctrine, as to better suit it to Burma’s unique status as a largely feudal, formerly colonized nation.§!"
BRM_syndicalist_party:0 "Young Workers’ Union"
BRM_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Young Workers’ Union\n§gThe Burmese Oil Workers’ Union, founded in 1921, was the first major Burmese trade union and played a large role in the nation’s nascent labour movement prior to the declaration of the Rangoon Republic. Nationalist parties, primarily the GCBA were quick to make alliances with the trade unionists, but no major labour reforms were carried out before foreign economic exploitation saw a major clampdown on trade union activities. It was not until the 1930s, when a new generation of well educated Burmese youth entered the workforce, that the labour movement resurfaced, now radicalized by Syndicalism. In collaboration with the Burmese Student Movement, many old trade unionists returned to politics and helped found the “Young Workers’ Union”, expanding their operations to cover a wider array of industries and trades.§!"

burma.0.t:0 "A War-torn Nation"
burma.0.d:0 "In 1921, when the Indian Revolution went into full swing, Burma was quick to follow. By 1925, independence had been de facto won with the Indian Civil War coming to a stalemate. Independence had been won but peace was far-off with the country in a quasi-civil war between the various minorities and the central government in Rangoon. In 1928, after a skirmish on the Siamese border, the Kingdom invaded and a year long bloody war followed. The Treaty of Moulmein, negotiated by Germany and Japan, brought an end to the conflict but ceded Lower Shan to Siam and left the occupation of Moulmein and lower Burma undecided. Humiliated, Chit Hlaing's GCBA government collapsed at the 1930 elections and U Ba Pe's Nationalist Party won in a tight victory. In the 1935, U Ba Pe and his reformed People's Party won another victory, against the backdrop of allegations of corruption and fraud. Since then, U Ba Pe has struggled to cement his rule against an increasingly radical and politically demanding populace. All the while, India waits for an opportunity to spread the revolution east. When the day comes, will Burma be ready?"
burma.0.a:0 "We shall pass through this hardship together!"
burma.1.t:0 "Riots and Protests at Rangoon University"
burma.1.d:0 "Dissatisfaction with corruption in the government, the immense patronage systems permeating civic life and U Ba Pe's unscrupulous rule, has sparked some of the greatest demonstrations seen in our country since independence was achieved in 1925. Stemming from the great and prestigious Rangoon University, radicalised leftist students have occupied several administrative buildings and held rallies denouncing the president and his wealthy backers as being corrupt and detrimental to the welfare of the nation. Still, the demonstrators haven't managed to garner the support of the industrial workers and rural farmers, restricting the budding movement to the intelligentsia."
burma.1.a:0 "Send in the batons and sabres!"
burma.2.t:0 "Riots and Protests at Rangoon University"
burma.2.d:0 "In neighbouring Burma, riots are spreading among a political impotent youth. Protesting against the rampant corruption at Rangoon University, lack of reform and the illegitimate rule of president U Ba Pe. For now the demonstrations have been restricted to Rangoon, but the inactivity of the current regime might spell another outburst in the months to come, especially with workers at the oil fields in Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu rumbling about lousy pay and poor living conditions. Should the two fractions unite we might find ourselves with a friendly government on the other side of the Bay of Bengal."
burma.2.a:0 "Let us keep a firm eye upon the Burmese!"
burma.3.t:0 "Strikes at Yenangyaung Oil Fields"
burma.3.d:0 "Workers at the oil fields around Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu have commenced a crippling strike in protest against rampant corruption and deplorable living conditions. Police units and paramilitary forces have in so far been completely unsuccessful in containing the protesters, who have occupied the oil fields, waving red flags and chanting socialist songs. Something must be done to placate their demands, lest national support for their cause explodes."
burma.3.a:0 "Upstarts! The labour movement must be crushed!"
burma.3.b:0 "Attempt to placate them..."
burma.4.t:0 "Rangoon Students Arise in Solidarity!"
burma.4.d:0 "Catastrophe! Just like the year before, students from Rangoon University has risen up against the presidency in critical demonstrations and protests. However, this year the radicalised student leaders, lamenting still rampant corruption and authoritarianism, have joined cause with the equally disgruntled oil workers in Yenangyaung, Chauk, and Minbu, giving the movement a truly national scope. Short of backing down, and staining the nation's honour, only a firm military reaction will solve this hopeless situation!"
burma.4.a:0 "This is outrageous, deploy the army against these youths!"
burma.5.t:0 "The Army is Ordered to Fire Upon Protesters"
burma.5.d:0 "After what seems an eternity, it has finally come down to a confrontation between the students protesting at Rangoon University and the Burmese Army. News have reached the local commanding officer that a march of striking oil workers is making its way towards the capital, gathering support from the rural villages along the way. On top of all, orders are ticking in from the general staff for the army to disperse the protesters, as the day winds down it seems that Burma's destiny is at hand."
burma.5.a:0 "...but joins the revolutionaries and overthrows the government!"
burma.5.b:0 "...and does so properly!"
burma.6.t:0 "The Proclamation of the Burmese Socialist Republic"
burma.6.d:0 "U Ba Pe's illegitimate republic has been driven out by a union of students, workers and the military, ushering in a time of progress under a socialist democratic government. However, the future of our country is still at hand as some leaders, under the command of U Ottama, within the opposition movement argue for reunion with India, namely the Calcutta government of the Bengal, Assam and Orissa. The National Council will have to make a decision."
burma.6.a:0 "We will stand with our brothers in Calcutta, independently!"
burma.6.b:0 "U Ottoma is right, apply for admission into the Indian Union."
burma.6.c:0 "Isolation served us well in the past, it will do so in the future as well!"
burma.7.t:0 "The Proclamation of the Burmese Socialist Republic"
burma.7.d:0 "In Burma, the corrupt U Ba Pe presidency has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter's peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Intimidated by the prospect of a possible renewed war with the Bangkok-based Chakri monarchy intervening on the side of the disenfranchised landowners, this new Burmese constellation has approached us with an offer of alliance, securing themselves against foreign involvement and gaining us a secure border to the East. Calcutta will have to answer swiftly and unequivocally lest this opportunity slip out of our hands."
burma.7.a:0 "Brothers in arms and socialism, we welcome them!"
burma.7.b:0 "Burma is nothing but the smelly armpit of the continent!"
burma.8.t:0 "The Burmese Republic Ascends to the Indian Union"
burma.8.d:0 "In Burma, the corrupt U Ba Pe presidency has been toppled by a coalition of protesting workers, students and an army refusing to carry out the order to massacre the latter's peaceful demonstrations. Power now resides with a provisional Burmese government, still infant in its position and beleaguered to the East by a hostile Siam. Within said new government, a faction led by U Ottoma has taken absolute control and has begun arguing for a reunification of the Burmese state with the naturally legal heir to the British Raj, namely our revolutionary Calcutta. A sizeable part of the Burmese state agrees with the proposition, hoping that united under one red banner we may obtain emancipation - not only for the workers and peasants of the Bengal, Orissa, Assam and Burma - but for all of India's oppressed working men and women. The cabinet will have to make its decision swiftly, lest popular support for this union evaporate."
burma.8.a:0 "Let us go forward together then, united in our struggle!"
burma.8.b:0 "We would prefer them to be allies instead."
burma.8.c:0 "We want nothing to do with their conflicts."
