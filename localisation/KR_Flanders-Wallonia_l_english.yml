### Events ###
bel.1.t:0 "Disaster of the 17th of February '36"
bel.1.d:0 "The 17th February, which marks the day that Adalbert I was crowned and took control of Belgium has yearly been marked with celebrations in the capital. Military parades and fanfares announced the start of the celebrations and at 12 'o clock Adalbert mounted the balcony of the palace watching over the Warande. As he addresses the population and celebrates another peaceful year, a loud bang resounded against the stone walls of the palace. In the midst of the crowd a group of revolter has fired a gun in the direction of the King. They shout "Vive la Révolution" and "Weg met de mof!". Dozens of men and women placed at tactical locations in the crowd by the combined resistance start rallying the people and prepare to storm the palace. Police quickly mobilises and forms a protective circle around the palace gates. The crowd starts dispersing into the surrounding streets and quickly the revolt becomes too large for the local police force."
bel.1.a:0 "Try to calm the protesters with small concessions"
bel.1.b:0 "Send in the army!"
bel.1.c:0 "We should wait for them to calm down"
bel.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Flanders-Wallonia!"
bel.2.d:0 "On the 2nd of February the German Stock Market crashed resulting in an economic crisis like never before. Flanders-Wallonia, already weakened by the reparations and reconstruction of its country has been hit very hard. Hundreds left the Brussels stock exchange crying and screaming. A Drastic action will be required to save the struggling people of Flanders-Wallonia."
bel.2.a:0 "What will we do?" 
bel.3.t:0 "Send in the Troops"
bel.3.d:0 "The closest division was quickly mobilised and used to suppress the rioters. The rioters however, enraged by the heavy weaponry, became even more violent and attacked the palace defences. The army was finally able to suppress the rioters by opening fire. 106 rioters would find their death the same day and hundreds more were arrested in the following days. We seem to have temporarily regained control but strong measures will have to be implemented to prevent another disaster. "
bel.3.a:0 "Prepare for further violence"
bel.4.t:0 "Make small concessions"
bel.4.d:0 "After summoning Parlement the King decided it was time for change."
bel.4.a:0 "You can now reform the Government"
bel.5.t:0 "Wait for them to calm down"
bel.5.d:0 "Trapped in the palace but safe from the rioters outside, the king decided not to result to heavy weaponry and try to calm the protesters by using local police force. The riot however would not be easily suppressed and started to spread throughout the entire city. Student organisations in the cities of Brussels itself, Leuven and Ghent had been preparing their own protest march and quickly organised themselves. Chanting the Brabançonne and the Vlaamse Leeuw, waving banners and protesting through the streets quickly became nearly too much for the police."
bel.5.a:0 "Its only becoming worse!"
bel.6.t:0 "Walloons in Charleroi and Mons rise up"
bel.6.d:0 "Massive strikes and protest are also plaguing Wallonia, where the large industrial cities of Charleroi and Mons have started organising themselves into a full scale rebellion. Supported by the syndicalist resistance and raids of the Police headquarters in Mons, the revolvers have reorganised themselves outside of the city biding their time."
bel.6.a:0 "Will this never end?"
bel.7.t:0 "Mass Desertion"
bel.7.d:0 "As the rebellion grows by the day, many soldiers of the former Belgian army have deserted and joined forces with the rebellion. Well armed they may pose a significant threat to our ability to suppress the revolt." 
bel.7.a:0 "Ask German reinforcements"
bel.7.b:0 "We can handle this on our own!"
bel.8.t:0 "Support for Independence grows"
bel.8.d:0 "As the different factions keep growing there will soon be a choice that might decide the future of our country. For the moment there is little contact between the Walloon rebels and the Flemish. It might be in our best interest to keep the situation separated until we can crack the rebellion down."
bel.8.a:0 "Keep them separated and we will prevail!"
bel.8.b:0 "We can't spare the resources at the moment."
bel.9.t:0 "Mayday"
bel.9.d:0 "On the first of May the syndicalists celebrate the fight for the 8-hour workday as described by the second Internationale in 1889. Despite the rebellion raging on throughout Belgium many syndicalists see this day as sacred and guerrilla strikes will be less fierce today. This could be our opportunity to organise a counter attack!"
bel.9.a:0 "Perform coordinated strikes against key figures."
bel.9.b:0 "Install a curfew in Liege, Namur and Charleroi."
bel.9.c:0 "It may be too dangerous to provoke them any further."
bel.10.t:0 "Assassination attempts have Failed!"
bel.10.d:0 "During the assault by our troops on the Charleroi Headquarters one of the soldiers who sympathised with the syndicalist cause turned his back on his fellow soldiers and lured them into a trap. Syndicalist forces could quickly capture the rest of his unit and are holding them hostage."
bel.10.a:0 "Is there nothing we can do right?"
bel.11.t:0 "Syndicalists and Royalists unite!"
bel.11.d:0 "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the Royalists and Syndicalists have reinforced their pact and set aside their differences until German occupation has come to an end."
bel.11.a:0 "They have only made themselves a bigger target!"
bel.12.t:0 "Syndicalists stand alone"
bel.12.d:0 "After we successfully cut the communications between Flemish and Walloon resistance, the syndicalists of Wallonia stand alone. With no real way to get support for their own free syndicalist state, they will have to seek aid from the Commune of France."
bel.12.a:0 "Finally a victory!"
bel.13.t:0 "Syndicalists strike back!"
bel.13.d:0 "After the catastrophic attack on the Charleroi headquarters the syndicalists are planning a massive terrorist attack on our infrastructure. We are however unable to reinforce both the army bases and our industrial complexes so we need to make a choice."
bel.13.a:0 "Protect the Army!"
bel.13.b:0 "Protect our Industry!"
bel.140.t:0 "Foundation of the 'Geuzengroep'"
bel.140.d:0 "Due to rising tensions in the Industrial city of Antwerp, a new resistance movement has been detected by our intelligence services. They are called the 'Geuzengroep' and seem to have gathered a lot of support around the harbour area, rallying the populace behind their cause. They seem to work mostly underground though and as such there seems to be no more intel about either their members or their leader."
bel.140.a:0 "Keep a close eye on them"
bel.141.t:0 "Attack on the Headquarters of the 'Vlaamse Wacht'"
bel.141.d:0 "During the night a dozen members of the Witte Brigade stormed the Headquarters of the 'Vlaamse Wacht' located in Antwerp. The 'Vlaamse Wacht' or Flemish watch, was used as a reserve for the Feldgendarmerie and held a large arsenal in reserve. It seems that they may have had assistance from the inside as they were able to quickly get in and leave before reinforcements could arrive. Voices in the Kings circles call for the abolishment of the 'Vlaamse Wacht' as they may betray us and side with Flemish Liberation movements."
bel.141.a:0 "Increase supervision of the 'Vlaamse Wacht'"
bel.141.b:0 "Abolish the 'Vlaamse Wacht'"
bel.142.t:0 "Loss of the 20th Train Convoy"
bel.142.d:0 "After the capture of a large terrorist cell trying to breach the Von Bissingkazerne in Mechelen, the commander has decided to transport the prisoners to a safer location closer to the main bulk of the army. 276 prisoners were put on the train convoy, called the 20th Train Convoy. Accompanied by a convoy of 15 soldiers and their officer, they left for Leuven. However between Boortmeerbeek and Haacht the train was stopped by three young men who under fire by the German forces opened the prison train and allowed 168 of the prisoners to escape before the Germans regained control of the train."
bel.142.a:0 "Strengthen the protection of our convoys!" 
bel.143.t:0 "Groupe G"
bel.143.d:0 "While our forces were engaged in Wallonia, a devastating terrorist attack was launched on the Electrical Train Network by the infamous Groupe G. They are a resistance movement composed almost entirely of students from the ULB, free university of Brussels. Encouraged by the protest at the universities of Gent and Leuven, a group of engineering students from the ULB prepared a nationwide attack on the railroad system. This was the first time an attack occured in both Flanders and Wallonia by the same group. We will have to stay wary of further cooperation between the two regions."
bel.143.a:0 "Track down these Students!"
bel.144.t:0 "Armée secrète/Geheim Leger"
bel.144.d:0 "Reports have reached us that the deserting forces are gathering in the villages around Poperinge. They seem to rally as close as possible to the French border, making large scale troop movements by us difficult. Charly Claser, leader of this movement has started to expand the group very fast, exceeding our expectations. They are however in contrast to the other groups an (secret) army with a chain of command and armed to the teeth. It will not be easy to crack them down and we will have to keep a close eye on them."
bel.144.a:0 "Station a small brigade in the city of Ieper to keep them in check"
bel.14.t:0 "Status Flemish Resistance"
bel.14.d:0 "While we were trying to counter the Walloon syndicalists and had to withdraw some of our forces out of Flanders, the Flemish decided to work more underground and have been recruiting members into their movement. Priests have tried to convince their parochians to take up arms and liberate the nation while s in the cities have diffused illegal newspapers and propaganda to enlist as many as possible. The recruited rebels, guided by experienced veterans from both the army and veterans from the Weltkrieg, also performed small, coordinated raids against German transports and have been able to acquire quite the armory. It's not yet clear what they are up to but it would be wise to reinforce our control over Flandres, risking loss of control elsewhere."
bel.14.a:0 "Fall back into Antwerp, Limburg and Flemish-Brabant!"
bel.14.b:0 "Fall back into Flemish-Brabant!"
bel.14.c:0 "Reinforce all provinces!"
bel.15.t:0 "11th of July"
bel.15.d:0 "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With the temporary retreat of the German forces the Flemish Resistance memorises this day and has proclaimed the 11th of July a national holiday."
bel.15.a:0 "Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"
bel.16.t:0 "11th of July"
bel.16.d:0 "The 11th of July 1302 will always be remembered as the great victory over the French army at the Guldensporenslag. On this day an inferior Flemish army defeated the French knights. This victory marked an important point in the creation of the Independent Flemish movement and has been immortalised in the roman by "De leeuw van Vlaanderen" by Hendrik Conscience. With German forces spread thin to suppress the resistance the Flemish Resistance has prepared a massive attack to liberate the cities of Bruges, Gent, Kortrijk and Oostende. Due to our small forces we were quickly overrun and after 5 hours of heavy fighting our last stronghold at the Gravensteen in Ghent fell and the Flemish Lion proudly waves atop its battlements."
bel.16.a:0 "We have lost control over West and East Flanders!"
bel.17.t:0 "Flemish offer a deal"
bel.17.d:0 "After the loss of great parts of Flanders, the Flemish Resistance has proposed a deal. They demand independence from Flanders-Wallonia and immediate retreat off all German forces out of Flandres. In exchange they are willing to remain part of Mittel-Europa and fulfil their role as buffer state and will not aid the Syndicalists in Wallonia in their struggle."
bel.17.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept these demands."
bel.17.b:0 "Never! How dare they assume we would accept their proposal!"
bel.18.t:0 "Walloons hear of Flemish Victories"
bel.18.d:0 "After the victories of the Flemish Resistance over the German forces the Walloons will have to decide whether or not to work together with the Flemish for an unified Belgium or to seek affiliation with the Commune of France. The syndicalists are neighed to join the commune and spread the socialist revolution. The royalists would prefer to work together with the Flemish to unify the country and reinstate the king. After days of discussion the doors of the headquarters finally open and the decision is announced."
bel.18.a:0 "We shall seek Unification with the French Commune"
bel.18.b:0 "We shall approach our Flemish brethren and try to reinstate Belgium."
bel.19.t:0 "Flandres receives Walloon Deal"
bel.19.d:0 "After the proposal to the German government has failed, the Flemish receive a deal from the Walloon movement. They ask the Flemish to work together with them to ensure Independence for all of Belgium and to reinstate the King."
bel.19.a:0 "Flanders shall be Independent!"
bel.19.b:0 ""Eendracht maakt Macht!""L'union fait la force!""Unity is Strength!""
bel.20.t:0 "Hainaut Attacks"
bel.20.d:0 "After the Flemish and Walloons made their pact to unify Belgium, they launched an assault on the German Administration Offices in Mons and secured the governor and his family. They are now held hostage and are demanding retreat of German Forces out of Hainaut. We have surrounded the building and are ready to move in if necessary. The chances of extracting the governor succesfully are slim but we could resecure the building to reinforce it against further attacks and to tighten our grip on the province."
bel.20.a:0 "Launch an Assault on the building!"
bel.20.b:0 "We will have to give in."
bel.21.t:0 "Hainaut secured."
bel.21.d:0 "After we stormed the building the rebels immediately executed the hostages and kept fighting to the last man. We were however able to retake the building with minimal losses and have established a perimeter. Barbed wire and machine gun posts were quickly installed to deter any further attack and part of the city has been evacuated to make place for the 2nd Walloon Division to set up camp."
bel.21.a:0 "Very well."
bel.22.t:0 "Rebels push into Antwerp"
bel.22.d:0 "With renewed forces and help from Wallonia the Flemish Resistance pushes into Antwerp. Fighting in the streets ensues immediately and for 3 days there seems to be no clear winner until a tank depot falls to the Flemish forces and the Germans retreat to the east side of the city. At the same time a push was orchestrated towards Boom and Dendermonde ensuring liberation of most of the province Antwerp."
bel.22.a:0 "Fall back to Brussels"
bel.23.t:0 "Flemish forces approach the capital"
bel.23.d:0 "With their victories in Antwerp and the retreat of German forces out of Limburg we are left with only Brussels and Wallonia. As the movement keeps winning they gather more support and by now they heavily outnumber us. The only forces we have left are the division located in Brussels and two in Wallonia. We will have to make an important decision which will decide the fate of the country. Will we retreat into Germany, thus liberating Belgium or will we dig in and try to hold out as long as we can, hoping that Germany may recover quickly enough to support us?"
bel.23.a:0 "We will not risk any more German blood."
bel.23.b:0 "Dig in boys, its gonna be a though fight!"
bel.24.t:0 "German forces return to Germany"
bel.24.d:0 "On September 13th 1936 at 2:37 PM in the Royal Palace signs the former King Adalbert the Ceasefire resulting in his immediate abdication, the return of all German forces to Germany and a truce between the reborn nation of Belgium and the German Empire. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children run into the streets waving the Belgian flag, chanting the Brabançonne and celebrating the regained independence. It truly is a great day for Belgium!"
bel.24.a:0 ""Lang leve België!""Vive la Belgique!""Long live Belgium!""
bel.241.t:0 "German forces return to Germany"
bel.241.d:0 "On September 20th 1936 at 2:37 PM in the Royal Palace signs the former King Adalbert the Ceasefire resulting in his immediate abdication, the return of all German forces to Germany and a truce between the reborn nation of Belgium and the German Empire. Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children run into the streets waving the Belgian flag, chanting the Brabançonne and celebrating the regained independence. It truly is a great day for Belgium!"
bel.241.a:0 ""Lang leve België!""Vive la Belgique!""Long live Belgium!""
bel.25.t:0 "Germans pushed back into Namur"
bel.25.d:0 "After our defeat at Mons and in return for the governor we have fallen back into Namur where we dug ourselves in. Any Walloon resistance will have to deal with our position and prepared troops!"
bel.25.a:0 "Watch out, those Walloons are everywhere!"
bel.26.t:0 "No further attack"
bel.26.d:0 "The Walloons have set up a perimeter around the city but aren't planning to immediately attack the city. They may be trying to secure Flanders first before moving any further."
bel.26.a:0 "Keep a close look on them"
bel.27.t:0 "Frontal Assault"
bel.27.d:0 "With our troops firmly dug in and awaiting the Rebel attack, news reaches us of a German Division stationed in German Wallonia being repositioned to Namur to help ward off the attack. The Rebels however have intercepted this message and have decided to attack as soon as they can. The troops surrounding Brussels move in under artillery support and the tanks captured in Antwerp swiftly breach our first line of defence. This is followed up by intense fighting in the metropolitan area of Brussels and is especially fierce in Schaarbeek en Dilbeek. Here the soldiers fight for every wall and heavy casualties on both sides occur. After 8 hours of heavy fighting our garrison is no longer able to keep them off and the rebel army marches on the palace."
bel.27.a:0 "Retreat to Namur"
bel.27.b:0 "Surrender to the Rebels"
bel.28.t:0 "Last Stand of Flandres-Wallonia"
bel.28.d:0 "Pushed back out of Brussels, the remaining army falls back into the city of Namur. Here the reinforcements from the German Empire have arrived and we are able to set up an adequate defence. We do however have a limited amount of supplies left after our defeat at Brussels and will most likely have to surrender within 3 months if we do not launch a counter-offensive."
bel.28.a:0 "Our situation is hopeless, we have to surrender"
bel.28.b:0 "Launch a counter-offensive on the Walloon perimeter"
bel.29.t:0 "Counter-offensive"
bel.29.d:0 "At 6:32 AM German artillery placed on top of the hill opened fire on the Walloon defences. They were followed up by an infantry assault trying to breach their line. Waves after waves of brave Germans threw themselves at the line but at 11:16 AM they had to retreat. The offensive has failed. German troops are exhausted and the Walloon line still stands."
bel.29.a:0 "Surrender to the rebels"
bel.30.t:0 "Ask for French support"
bel.30.d:0 "Cut of from the Flemish resistance, with not enough support to frontally assault the German government it seems that asking aid from the Internationale is the only thing the Syndicalists can do to prevent the failure of their struggle. France might however not be interested in such an arrangement not to anger the German Reich and might deny their proposal."
bel.30.a:0 "The French better stay out of this"
bel.31.t:0 "Support our Wallonian Brethren"
bel.31.d:0 "A messenger has arrived from the syndicalist movement in Belgium calling for our aid in overthrowing their German government. They are however already severely weakened and it's just a matter of time before their rebellion is crushed. The only way to save the syndicalist cause in Flanders-Wallonia would be by launching a full invasion and as such declaring war on the German Empire itself. Advisors of the government insist that such an invasion would be prematurely and we should wait before we strike the Empire."
bel.31.a:0 "Nonsense, we will not abandon our fellow syndicalists!"
bel.31.b:0 "It would be wise to bide our time for now"
bel.32.t:0 "Beginning of the Second Weltkrieg!"
bel.32.d:0 "As planes soar over the Walloon countryside, infantry bataljons move into Wallonia. French aid has come and the Second Weltkrieg is about to begin. With Germany severely weakened by Black Monday it will have to be seen if they can defend against the French hordes."
bel.32.a:0 "A dark day for Germany and therefor the world!"
bel.33.t:0 "Eradicate the Syndicalist uprising!"
bel.33.d:0 "With no further support the Walloon rebellion will be dealt with in due time and we can concentrate more of our power on the Flemish front."
bel.33.a:0 "Did they really think they could defeat us?"
bel.34.t:0 "The Kingdom strikes back"
bel.34.d:0 "With no support from the other side of the language border and outgunned by the German government the rebellion is doomed to fail. Repression will be severe but righteous as we will try to avoid any further rebellions. The government will have to be reformed to make sure that we are better prepared next time."
bel.34.a:0 "Let's get on with it!"
bel.35.t:0 "The Belgian Flag"
bel.35.d:0 "After our victory over the German occupators, the temporary government has decided to reinstate the Belgian flag to bolster morale and to show the world that Belgium is free once more. Hoisted atop the royal Palace the Flag waves proudly in the wind."
bel.35.a:0 "Black Yellow Red once more!"

bel.36.t:0 "Who will take control?"
bel.36.d:0 "With the German king abdicated and the country liberated it's finally time to reshape Belgium into a free and prosperous power. There is however no clear leader and rebuilding an able government might not be an easy task. Four main parties are vying for the office of prime minister. The KP/DC or Christian party has ruled Belgium for many years and is known for their conservative and Christian view. Verdinaso known for their nationalist and right leaning ideas stand for a strong and independent Belgium relying on its army and industry. BWP or the syndicalist party stands for a Workers First policy and will try to revive the Belgian industry with it's famous Plan De Man.

The KP, the largest pre-Weltkrieg party and biggest proponent of the rebellion in Flanders, is trying to reestablish their Party and has placed Paul Van Zeeland as their candidate. Finally the  BWP, or Belgian Workers Party, has tried to win as much support within the worker class as possible.

Three main splinter factions have been created and are each proposing their own agenda. Paul-Henri Spaak, influenced by his liberal heritage has created a social liberal faction and has proposed a clear plan to guide Belgium. Another movement has declared their support for a grand industrial plan, Plan De Man, and have distanced themselves from the main party. The remnants of the party are still struggling to reform the party but have promised to continue their syndicalist agenda.

Hendrik De Man on the other hand is more closely leaning to the social-democratist side and will revive the Belgian economy with his famous Plan De Man. There is however discontent in the party as some of the more extreme members find the current agenda of the party far too soft and would like to reform Belgium into a Syndicalist state mirroring it's southern neigbour.

With many of the original force feeling abandonned by their leaders, large groups of men left the corps. The remaining parts of the Corps have however embraced their higher status and have established themselves as a form of secret police.

bel.8041.d:0 "Due to the abolishment of our Flemish secret police force, it appears that the spread of illegal propaganda has increased. The Rebels may have the possibility now to further expand their movement and we will have to use more of our own resources to surpress the movement."
bel.8041.a:0 "More overtime for our police!"
bel.805.t:0 "Feldgendarmerie"
bel.805.d:0 "News of our trouble pacifying Flanders-Wallonia has reached Berlin and has greatly troubled the Kaiser. The only way that a strong front line can exist is if the populace is statisfied enough. Therefore the Kaiser has given the order to send a specialised division of the Feldgendarmerie to aid the Flandern-Wallonian police force in their struggle. Relying on foreign aid to combat the issue may however further alienate the King from his citizens."
bel.805.a:0 "Accept the help from Berlin"
bel.805.b:0 "Politely decline German help"
bel.806.t:0 "Large smuggling operation caught"
bel.806.d:0 "During a routine inspection of the police around the station of Gent-Sint-Pieters, an unidentified train wagon was found containing military supplies. With all weapons and equipment stripped of any markings, it's difficult to identify their origin but many inside the corps suspect they may originate from the French Commune. Other suspects are the Netherlands whom may be trying to reinstate their kingdom by liberating Flanders. We can't however make false acusations so we will have to choose which ambassador to confront."
bel.806.a:0 "This is clearly done by the Syndicalist rabble!"
bel.806.b:0 "Bring me the Dutch ambassador, he will have to explain this!" 
bel.8061.t:0 "Audience with the French Ambassador"
bel.8061.d:0 "The French ambassador has been called immediately to the palace and after a short interrogation has denied all accusations. He warned us however that increasing our Border forces could lead to unwanted escalations and advised us to drop the matter."
bel.8061.a:0 "Who does this Frenchman think that he is?"
bel.8062.t:0 "Audience with the Dutch Ambassador"
bel.8062.d:0 "The Dutch ambassador has been called immediately to the palace and even though a short interrogation did not give us the answers that we sought for, the ambassador has promised us that they will tighten their border security to make sure that no weapon shipments or other illegal goods are able to enter our country from their border."
bel.8062.a:0 "Very well"
bel.807.t:0 "Front de l'indépendance"
bel.807.d:0 "We have received shocking reports from the Walloon detachement of the Feldgendarmerie indicating a recent surge in armed socialist resistance. A new resistance group, calling themselves "Front de l'indépendance" is growing in size and deadliness. Determined to bring totalism to the state of Flanders-Wallonia, they do not shy from using armed violence against those who oppose them."
bel.807.a:0 "Formulate a plan of action and destroy this resistance!"
bel.808.t:0 "Discovery of Die Rote Kapelle"
bel.808.d:0 "Die Rote Kapelle or the Red Orchestra, is the largest syndicalist resistance network in Europe. With members spread over the continent and assistance from both Paris and London, this inteligence group is huge threat to our national security. Due to their non-violent nature, they are difficult to track down and until now all attempts have yielded no results. Now however Efremov, leader of the Flanders-Wallonian branch has been captured in Oostende while trying to move to another safehouse. He was immediately interrogated and at last he gave up important members of the movement. After a wave of arrests in the following hours, 30 members were caught and executed. A heavy blow has been dealt to the organisation."
bel.808.a:0 "Finally results!"
bel.81.t:0 "Germans demand more Taxation"
bel.81.d:0 "With the German Empire slowly recovering from Black Monday they have demanded our King to institute a large tax aimed at the middle and lower class to help the German economy. Flanders-Wallonia however has also been hit very hard as the country is heavily industrialised and due to the crisis has left many citizens without jobs. A High tax would certainly improve our relations with Berlin but may severely hurt our own chances of a quick recovery."
bel.81.a:0 "Implement the Full Tax"
bel.81.b:0 "Implement a Smaller Tax"
bel.81.c:0 "Refuse German demands"
bel.82.t:0 "Trade Agreement with the German Empire"
bel.82.d:0 "Due to the aftermath of Black Monday it's time to sign a new trade agreement with the Empire. With a strong industry based around Steel, Textiles and chemical expertise Flanders-Wallonia is one of the major industrial powers in Mittel-Europa. Therefore a large portion of German Imports come from our country. Now it's however time to renew the agreement and decide whether to keep focusing on exporting to the Empire or to focus more on benefitting Flanders-Wallonia itself."
bel.82.a:0 "Focus on benefitting the Empire"
bel.82.b:0 "We should favour neither party"
bel.82.c:0 "Focus on a Flanders-Wallonia first policy"
bel.83.t:0 "Weapons production for the German Army"
bel.83.d:0 "Due to the large scale preparations of the German Empire, caused by new border conflicts with the French Commune the German Army has started a process of quickly rebuilding and expanding. For this expansion they require specialised equipment. Flanders-Wallonian expertise concerning small Fire-arms and anti-tank canons is widely appreciated and praised along German High Command. Therefore the Empire has offered us a deal where we supply them with weapons in exchange for monetary compensation. Due to the high demand by their army the supply for our own army may suffer shortages."
bel.83.a:0 "Export as many weapons as they require"
bel.83.b:0 "Prioritize our own army"
bel.831.t:0 "State Treasury Investigation"
bel.831.d:0 "Every year a special commission is established by parliament to investigate the entire monetary balance of the country. This has since the start of the occupation been the the task of members of the Flemish Council though due to recent events the King is inclined to let an outside German commission investigate to make sure that any corruption or covert operations are discovered. This would cause extreme turmoil though in Parliament as members would see this as yet another power grab from the King while neglecting the wishes of the people."
bel.831.a:0 "Send word to Germany"
bel.831.b:0 "Allow the Flemish Council to handle the affair"
bel.832.t:0 "The investigation progresses"
bel.832.d:0 "As the Flemish Council goes through the budget like it has done every year it has encountered a large source of expenses. Recent renovations to the Palace and the German Embassy have cost the taxpayer for millions of Reichsmark. In these troubling times such expenses should not be allowed and will only further increase the burden of the common man. Therefore the Council has proposed to the King to delay the Works until after the Crisis situation is handled."
bel.832.a:0 "Nonsense, a King cannot rule without a Palace!"
bel.832.b:0 "We will temporarily retreat to Laken until work can resume"
bel.837.t:0 "Investigation takes a turn"
bel.837.d:0 "When investigating the military budget for last year, a lot of small unidentified expenses were discovered. The puchase of a shipment of weapons from the German Empire, support equipment from Swiss and even an armoured convoy from the Netherlands. When verifying the destination of this equipment all signs point to the Leopoldskazerne in Ghent. This barracks has however not been used since 1933 when it was transformed into a hospital. It's as of yet unclear who authorised the purchases but main suspects are low ranking members of the Flemish Council whom may be aiding the rebels."
bel.837.a:0 "Continue the investigation"
bel.838.t:0 "The trail ends"
bel.838.d:0 "After carefully following every lead, we did not get the results we hoped for. Some members of the council have been interogated and even though some may have connections with the resistance, there is no clear evidence. We will let the secret police further identify this issue but for the time being no culprit has been found."
bel.838.a:0 "Keep searching" 
#bel.838.t:0 "Trouble implementing reforms"
#bel.838.d:0 "The head of the reformation commission which we picked in October seems to be having trouble implementing the requested reforms. Slowdowns, high costs and annoying bureaucratic struggles keep delaying the reforms. It's clear that at this pace it will take until 1940 before the first reforms are implemented. Replacing the favourite of parliament however for our own could lead to friction and should only be considered as a last resort."
#bel.838.a:0 "I'm sick of it, sack the man!"
#bel.838.b:0 "Give him some more time"
bel.839.t:0 "Large underground network discovered"
bel.839.d:0 "The head of the task force aimed at uncovering the Flemish Conspiracy has returned with results. It seems that the shipments directed to the Leopoldskazerne originate from a high level circle of the Flemish Council. Frans van Cauwelaert has been placed at the head of this organisation and has been responsible for unrest and dissent since the Weltkrieg. It seems that they tried to shuffle funds into Resistance hands by infiltrants in the Post Service. They were also able to spread their propaganda by the same channel and have been secretly organising rally's and meetings discussing the liberation of both Belgium and Flanders."
bel.839.a:0 "Firmly root out this weed!"
bel.840.t:0 "Van Cauwelaert on the run"
bel.840.d:0 "With a warrant for his arrest signed by the King himself, police forces surrounded his house in Brussels and tried to capture him. He must have been warned in advance however as all they found was an empty house and a smouldering fireplace. Police and Feldgendarmerie are organising a manhunt to quickly put an end to his treason."
bel.840.a:0 "Find him quickly!"
bel.841.t:0 "Van Cauwelaert caught!"
bel.841.d:0 "After only a few days police finally caught up with van Cauwelaert as he was trying to cross the French border near the village of Paradijs. With the capture of such a high level member of the resistance we may finally be able to deal a blow back."
bel.841.a:0 "So close to paradise, yet so far!"
bel.842.t:0 "German Favouritism"
bel.842.d:0 "Citizens in Flanders-Wallonia, though equal for the law, stand along a social hierarchy created by origin. German immigrants or citizens from the Empire are more likely to reach high ranking positions and seem to be able to exert more influence over the country than Flemish-Wallonian citizens. While this way of handling things is appreciated by the German population, it makes our other citizens very discontent. Joris Van Severen, member of the Flemish Council has proposed a solution to this problem by combating this favouritism. It would be greatly beneficial for the order and peace in the country but would receive fierce opposition in the German Empire."
bel.842.a:0 "We will not change our way of life for these pesky peasants"
bel.842.b:0 "Allow Van Severen to go ahead"
bel.843.t:0 "German citizens protest"
bel.843.d:0 "Due to recent reforms introduced by Joris Van Severen, concerning the status of German citizens, many have come down to the capital today to protest against this sudden turn by the government. Even though their numbers are small, a large outflux of money caused by their distrust in the government could be painful. Therefore Van Severen has proposed a very drastic plan which would allow us to seize their Flandern-Wallonian holdings if they decide to revolt. It's clear that such an action would provoke hostility with the Fatherland and especially with our German population."
bel.843.a:0 "Let's not do anything rash"
bel.843.b:0 "Allow Van Severen to go ahead"
bel.844.t:0 "Emigration to Germany has begun"
bel.844.d:0 "Due to not letting Van Severen handle the situation, many of the richer Germans which benefited greatly from our favouritism policy, large sums of money are leaving the country. We can introduce a small tax cut for these upper class citizens to make them more likely to stay."
bel.844.a:0 "Propose the tax cut"
bel.844.b:0 "We don't need their kind anyway!"
bel.845.t:0 "Flemish Coup"
bel.845.d:0 "Around Lunch time, when Adalbert was enjoying his lunch in the royal palace, everything suddenly shot into action. Flemish nationalists sick of German tyranny had slowly been expanding their influence and after recent reforms by the King were finally able to excecute their coup. Around 12:47 PM, members of the Vlaamse Wacht with orders from Van Severen and other members of the Council departed in trucks from their barracks in Brussels. A first detachement rushed towards the federal parliament which was in session. By quickly overwhelming the security guards they were able to establish a fortified position and kept parliament hostage. Another detachement headed straight for the royal palace.  By using a special truck they rammed in the front gate and stormed straight to the palace. Overwhelming the royal guard, they were able to secure the palace. With a swift and powerful strike, the government was disabled."
bel.845.a:0 "Oh..."
bel.846.t:0 "German Troops react"
bel.846.d:0 "After the first shock, troops from the army barracks situated around the city mobilised and rushed towards the city. In the city however, they were met with fierce resistance from the Underground movement which saw an opportunity and helped excecute the Coup. Unable to reach the Palace in time, Vlaamse Wacht quickly breached the last line of defence and poured into the royal dining room. There they met Adalbert, enjoying his soup and completely unaware of the situation. Hendrik Elias, head of the Vlaamse Wacht proposes him an ultimatum: He either abdicates voluntarily as King of Flanders-Wallonia and stays as a hostage until arrangements with the German Epire have been made or he is shot there and then."
bel.846.a:0 "Abdicate"
bel.846.b:0 "Schmutzige flämische Schweine...!!"
bel.847.t:0 "The Flemish Council takes control"
bel.847.d:0 "With Adalbert deposed off, Joris Van Severen has succesfully taken control and declares himself leader of the country until the situation has calmed down. German citizens, fearing for their lifes are fleeing the country as quickly as they can leaving much of their wealth behind."
bel.847.a:0 "Take revenge for the Rape of Belgium!"
bel.847.b:0 "We are decent men"
bel.848.t:0 "Change of Power"
bel.848.d:0 "With the Flemish Council firmly in control, many of the highranking officials of the other parties fear that Van Severen is planning on instating a military government instead of letting the elections go ahead."
bel.848.a:0 "Belgium will remain a free democratic country!"
bel.848.b:0 "Only a strong government can save us!"
bel.849.t:0 "Reform the Voting System"
bel.849.d:0 "To further consolidate his power, the King has decided to reverse the universal suffrage that was only recently introduced in Flanders-Wallonia. As such his commands will be unchallenged as only the most loyal of his subjects will be granted voting rights. Advisors in the government however have suggested the King not to take such drastic action and to just "influence" the results of the elections."
bel.849.a:0 "Reintroduce Census Voting"
bel.849.b:0 "Rig Universal Suffrage"
bel.84.t:0 "21st of July"
bel.84.d:0 "As the 21st of July approaches, preparations are being made to forbid any festivities and to prevent a disaster like 2 years ago. Voices in parliament and on the streets are asking however that the King allows for regulated festivities in villages and cities to lift the spirits in these times of crisis. This kind of action would greatly boost the Kings standing in Flanders-Wallonia but would not be accepted by the German government."
bel.84.a:0 "Forbid all festivities"
bel.84.b:0 "Allow for small regulated gatherings in the cities"
bel.84.c:0 "Allow the population to express themselves as they desire"
bel.85.t:0 "Syndicalist Question"
bel.85.d:0 "With the syndicalist party growing in popularity among the populace due to the unemployment crisis, it may be time for us to allow them to send representatives to parliament to express their wishes. Even though the German Empire has expressed their hostility towards the party, they are clearly connected to our citizens and may have a valuable opinion. This action might also further evolve our government to a more democratic system."
bel.85.a:0 "Allow all opposition parties a fair chance in elections"
bel.85.b:0 "Allow the syndicalists to organise and develop cooperatives to benefit the lower class"
bel.85.c:0 "The system will remain as it is"
bel.86.t:0 "Language Question"
bel.86.d:0 "Flanders-Wallonia is a very divided country due to the communication difficulties. French upper class has always governed the country before German Occupation and has always regarded the French language as the language of the state. The military as well suffered heavily during the first Weltkrieg from this divide with French officers not being able to communicate with their Flemish foot soldiers. The Flemish people have always found themselves to be misrepresented by these French aristocrats and have led to a certain hostility between the two groups. With the arrival of the German occupation there have been some improvements made towards the Dutch speaking communities but they have primarly just taken over from the French Elite and have created a similar situation wherein both French speaking as well as Dutch speaking population have less rights than the German invaders. Because of the large scale reforms of the military the time has however come to improve national unity by allowing soldiers and politicians from all 3 languages to climb up the ranks."
bel.86.a:0 "Allow only German Officers"

bel.87.d:0 "Due to a particulary bad harvest and the increased maintenance cost of the German army due to the large expansions, the German government has demanded that the agricultary well-developped Flemish region sends large supplies of Grain and Potatoes back to Germany to feed their soldiers. Flanders however has also had a bad harvest and complying to all German demands may cause a famine in our own country. The German government however would greatly disapprove our decision to prioritise our own people and may penalise us with economic sanctions."

bel.89.a:0 "We were planning on breaking free anyway"
bel.90.t:0 "Bad German Relations"
bel.90.d:0 "Our relations with the Kaiser have deteriorated quite badly and the Empire might punish us for our disrespect. Respect for Adalbert however has increased and more people are willing to sign up to defend their country in the name of the King."
bel.90.a:0 "We must be careful"
bel.91.t:0 "Neutral German Relations"
bel.91.d:0 "The Empire tolerates our actions but is not quite pleased by recent reforms. There is no real patriotic Flemish-Wallonian idea but a decent amount of people have decided that if war comes to our country they are willing to defend it."

bel.93.t:0 "Very good German Relations"

#Introduction
bel.94.t:0 "Status Report 1 : Location of Flanders-Wallonia"
bel.94.d:0 "Located on the Western border of the German Empire and bordering the Commune of France, Flanders-Wallonia has a very strategic but vulnerable position. As the vanguard of the West against the Syndicalist menace we are supposed to stop their advance on the bunkers of the Ludendorfflinie and push together with our German allies into the French hearthland. To the East the German behemoth watches us closely and will prove to be a difficult enemy should the need arise. North of us lie the Netherlands: neutral in the Weltkrieg, our former masters don't seem much of a threat with their ill-equipped army and friendly relations."
bel.94.a:0 "Very well"
bel.95.t:0 "Status Report 2 : Economy of Flanders-Wallonia"
bel.95.d:0 "Occupation and major battles during the first Weltkrieg have clearly marked our country and hefty reparations and general dismantlement of our Industrial base have left us weak. What was once the 8th greatest industrial powerhouse in the world has been greatly harmed. Our people however are sturdy and were capable of rebuilding the industrial power back to somewhat of it's older glory. Much work however has to be done as much of the industry is reliant on German investements. To reinvigorate the economy the Adalbert Canal has been dug connecting the important harbour of Antwerp with the Steel industries of Liège. Coal mining has been expanded into the province of Limburg further stimulating the steel industry while the Flemish provinces have steadily developped their industrial power to partially replace the old Agricultural countryside."
bel.95.a:0 "Very well"
bel.96.t:0 "Status Report 3 : Political situation in Flanders-Wallonia"
bel.96.d:0 "Even though our country is a constitutional monarchy on paper, parliamentary control over the government is severely hampered. Moreover, political parties can only have a legal status and participate in elections if they accept the post-Weltkrieg stautus quo such as the Hohenzollern Monarchy, membership in Mitteleuropa etc. This limitation makes legal opposition parties stunted and ineffective. The government is advised by the Flemish Council which consists mainly of members of the higher class. They support the king and execute his decisions but have limited power. Two major opposition groups however contest this and are forced underground. First we have the royalist catholic party who seeks to restore Belgium and it's rightfull king Albert I, in exile in Canada. The other large group is the syndicalist party trying to improve working conditions and create a socialist regime like the Commune of France. Both of these groups have stronger ties in Wallonia with occasional frictions. The catholic party is however also widely accepted in the agrarian region of Flanders which still holds on the Catholic faith."

Upon further investigation 3 of the 4 men are designated members of the Deurne police force, thus invoking the question whether we can trust our own police force. The ministry of Defence has answered with force that only a full overhaul of the selection and training program of our force can prevent further trouble."
