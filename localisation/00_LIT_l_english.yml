 ### Events ###
 
lithuania.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania in 1936"
lithuania.1.d:0 "O Lithuania, land of the brave, where oaks grow strong and the people are hardy. What an ironic twist of fate it is that you were saved and 'freed' by the progeny of the same Teutons that pillaged and ravaged your land. You are once more a Kingdom, 700 years after the death of King Mindaugas I, and yet you are a mere puppet state in the middle of Mitteleuropa. While you are not as German-dominated as the United Baltic Duchy in the North, your position is still unbearable."
lithuania.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
lithuania.1.b:0 "Yada, yada, just let me play!"

lithuania.2.t:0 "The Kingdom's State of Politics"
lithuania.2.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the Kingdom in 1918, and especially after Syndicalist revolutions in the West, Lithuania has been dominated strictly by conservative politics. The clerical, pro-German and anti-Syndicalist Lithuanian Christian Democrats have worked hard to modernize your economy, but their reign might just come to an end, challenged by the nationalist and anti-German 'Party of Lithuanian Interests' led by Augustinas Voldemaras, as well as the resurgent Social Democrats under Vladas Pozela."
lithuania.2.a:0 "Really?"

lithuania.3.t:0 "The Kingdom's Overall Situation"
lithuania.3.d:0 "Lithuania is arguably the weakest member of Mitteleuropa, but it is critical to the effort of the Germans. It holds a strategic position between East Prussia and Germany's East Slavic puppets and it's the Kaiserreich's only meaningful way of access to the United Baltic Duchy. As such, the Kaiser will be more than willing to reign Lithuania in if it tries to rebel. Russia has a lot of interest in Lithuania, too, and the Belarusian minorities in the Vilnius region have led to friction between the Kingdom and the White Ruthenians. And what of the incoming clash with the International?.."
lithuania.3.a:0 "I'd rather play as Poland."

lithuania.4.t:0 "Adolfas Šapoka writes 'Lietuvos Istorija'"
lithuania.4.d:0 "A young Lithuanian historian, Adolfas Šapoka, has written and published a 600 page tome on the history of Lithuania from it's creation to present day. Seen as highly patriotic and pro-Lithuanian, it is definitely aligned with the views of the Lithuanian nationalists, and yet has been critically acclaimed and distributed across the country, with over 100 000 copies released by the end of the year."
lithuania.4.a:0 "A fine read. But also quite troubling."

lithuania.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Lithuania!"
lithuania.5.d:0 "The rampaging economic downturn that started with the Berlin Stock Exchange has not left us out of the chaos. Now that hundreds of industries in Germany are closing and others kicking out unneeded workers, the demand for Lithuanian agricultural and industrial produces dropped like a rock. Fields are left deserted, unemployed workers line up for soup kitchens by the hundreds and the gross domestic product has plummeted. \n What can the poor Lithuanians do against this travesty?"
lithuania.5.a:0 "Who's going to buy our butter and geese now?"

lithuania.6.t:0 "Response to Black Monday"
lithuania.6.d:0 "An emergency session of the Seimas has gathered today to discuss the matters of the Lithuanian economy, which are getting worse by the minute. More and more factories are closing. Farmers, unable to sell their produces, sell their cows and spill their milk on the sidewalks. The unemployed gather in soup kitchens to survive. The Seimas is split between two major factions, both of which have their own ideas on how to solve the situation and get out of the Depression that has been caused by the Black Monday."
lithuania.6.a:0 "V.V. Carneckis - the state should build up profitable industries and industrialize"
lithuania.6.b:0 "J. Pleckaitis - the system must be reorganized to help the common man"

lithuania.7.t:0 "The economy has recovered"
lithuania.7.d:0 "After a long time of recovery and fighting the plague that was the economic crash of the Black Monday, the economy of Lithuania has seemingly started to recover. Unemployment is dropping and the value of the Lithuanian mark is finally coming back to pre-1936 levels. In slightly more morbid news, the suicide rate, previously leading in the entirety of Europe, is finally lower..." 
lithuania.7.a:0 "Good. I'll go loosen the noose, then."

lithuania.8.t:0 "The Third Front"
lithuania.8.d:0 "While syndicalist wretches are thriving in the French commune and the rest of the Internationale, Lithuania used to be solidly defended by these ideas. That has been proven false by the discovery of an underground newspaper called 'The Third Front' (Trecias frontas). While it presents itself as a collection of modernist avant-garde literature that can't be published in traditional media, it is also heavily far-left and agitates for ushering in a new and better Syndicalist government in the nation. How should we respond?"
lithuania.8.a:0 "They are no threat, syndicalism cannot thrive here"
lithuania.8.b:0 "Disperse their circles!"

lithuania.9.t:0 "Nationalist Rally"
lithuania.9.d:0 "The streets are filled with patriotic members of the Speak Lithuanian movement today, with over a few thousand activists marching across the city and demanding to rid the country of German influence. \n After visiting the local cenetery to pay respects to the heroes that fought in the Weltkrieg to create the nation as we know it, then returned to the cities, where minor violence began. A few civilians, most of German origin, were injured, a few store windows were left broken and shattered, but eventually the crowds dispersed. \n A few of the most radical participants were arrested, but they are small fries compared to the men organizing this mess..."
lithuania.9.a:0 "Horrible!"

lithuania.10.t:0 "Ignas Jurkūnas, 'Raudonasis tvanas'"
lithuania.10.d:0 "Ignas Jurkūnas, commonly known by his pseudonym 'Ignas Šeinius', has recently written a new book, titled 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood). Much like his famous 'Kuprelis' (The Hunchback), this story is written as a gripping impressionist tale, a love story between a Lithuanian partisan fighter and the daughter of a Russian colonist family, but what is most interesting is the setting of this story. \nThe novel is set in a different universe, where the Entente powers won the Weltkrieg. After being overrun by Allied forces, Germany falls to a Syndicalist revolution, while Russia is successfully couped by Kolchak and is transformed into a totalitarian dictatorship with mass indoctrination and state chauvinist policies. Lithuania, much like the rest of Europe, is turned into a battlefield between the 'Axis of Socialist Nations' led by Germany and the remnants of the Entente, and this is where the story takes place. \nThe novel has been criticised for intimidating descriptions of brutality and war crimes, but Jurkūnas defends his creation, saying that 'the horrors of war happen in all conflicts, and this war might have happened in an another Universe'"
lithuania.10.a:0 "A fine read. Hopefully this doesn't happen here, though..."

lithuania.11.t:0 "Election of 1938"
lithuania.11.d:0 "The early rays of the spring sun have begun to melt down the snow across the country, but the politics of the nation are as unstable as ever. Parades of Nationalist militias and dissenters flood the streets hoping for a victory at the election, and the voter turnout has been the highest since the nation's inception. The Christian-Democrats received blows to their popularity from the events of Black Monday, but nevertheless remain strong, while the Social-Democrats are attempting to rally the working class into voting for them. How will the people decide?"
lithuania.11.a:0 "The Christian Democrats remain in power"
lithuania.11.b:0 "Social-Democrats secure a majority"
lithuania.11.c:0 "A coalition of Nationalist parties led by Voldemaras obtain victory"
