 heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered."
 battle_cruiser_pre:0 "Battle Cruiser Pre-WW1"
 battle_cruiser_pre_desc:0 "The first battlecruisers were designed in the United Kingdom in the first decade of the century, as a development of the armoured cruiser, at the same time as the dreadnought succeeded the pre-dreadnought battleship. The goal of the design was to outrun any ship with similar armament, and chase down any ship with lesser armament; they were intended to hunt down slower, older armoured cruisers and destroy them with heavy gunfire while avoiding combat with the more powerful but slower battleships. However, as more and more battlecruisers were built, they were increasingly used alongside the better-protected battleships."

#### JAP - JAPAN ####
 JAP_submarine_pre:1 "Kaichu Class"
 JAP_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The Kaichu class submarines were built after WWI and based on the earlier submarines. These medium-sized submarines were adequately armed, possesses good operational range and had good speed for their time, but by 1938 they were somewhat outdated. Altogether 42 Kaichu type submarines were built for the IJN and the series included 7 variants."
 JAP_submarine_1:1 "Kaidai III Class"
 JAP_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Kaidai type submarine (Kaidai-gata sensuikan) was a type of 1st class submarine operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) before and during World War II. The type name, was shortened to Kaigun-shiki Ōgata Sensuikan. The nine Kaidai IIIs were based on earlier designs, but featured a strengthened hull. The "IIIb" types were 40 cm longer and had a different bow design. All nine boats were constructed between 1927 and 1930."
 JAP_destroyer_pre:1 "Momi Class"
 JAP_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Momi class was a development of the Enoki second-class destroyers, relying on the same basic hull. They were quite small, comparable to Royal Navy corvettes. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers captured during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."
 JAP_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Suma Class"
 JAP_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "While more lightly armed and armored than many of its contemporaries, their small size and relatively simple design facilitated their construction and their relatively high speed made them useful for many military operations. Both participated in combat during the Russo-Japanese War and World War I."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Izumo Class"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Izumo-class cruisers were a pair of armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the late 1890s. As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the vessels were built in Britain. They were part of the 'Six-Six Fleet' expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05—the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima—but played a much more minor role in World War I."
 JAP_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Tsukuba Class"
 JAP_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Tsukuba-class cruisers were a pair of large armored cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) in the first decade of the 20th century. Construction began during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 and their design was influenced by the IJN's experiences during the war. The British development of the battlecruiser the year after Tsukuba was completed made her and her sister ship Ikoma obsolete, as they were slower and more weakly armed than the British, and later German, ships. Despite this, they were reclassified in 1912 as battlecruisers by the IJN."
 JAP_battleship_pre:1 "Fuso Class"
 JAP_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Fuso class battleships were built during WWI and modernized in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armored and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centerline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry." 
 JAP_battleship_1:1 "Nagato Class"
 JAP_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Nagato-class battleships were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during World War I, although they were not completed until after the end of the war. Nagato, the lead ship of the class, frequently served as a flagship. Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923. They were modernized in 1933–36 with improvements to their armor and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style."
 JAP_carrier_pre:1 "Hosho Class"
 JAP_carrier_pre_desc:1 "Hōshō, literally 'phoenix in flight' was the world's first commissioned ship that was designed and built as an aircraft carrier, and the first aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN). Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. Hōshō's superstructure and other obstructions to the flight deck were removed in 1924 on the advice of experienced aircrews."
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:1 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was one of Japan's first fleet carriers. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier. This resulted in a large and heavily armored carrier with limited space for improvement. However, it was an important experience in aircraft carrier construction for the Imperial Japanese Navy."

### RUS - Russia ###

RUS_destroyer_pre:0 "Novik Class"
RUS_destroyer_1:0 "Orfey Class"
RUS_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Orfey class destroyers are an improved version of the previous Novik class. They feature a decent surface and AA armament for their size, a somewhat short range, but a good speed and a heavy torpedo armament. The succeeding Fidonisy and Izyaslav classes are further improved versions of this class with an increased main armament and hull size."
RUS_destroyer_2:0 "Gnevny Class"
RUS_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The Gnevny class destroyers are an important part of the 1934-1937 shipbuilding program. The class itself is heavily influenced by the latest foreign projects and considered a successful design. Their weight is in the range of 1,600-2,000 tons, they are well-armed and have a decent AA and torpedo armament. Due to their powerful engines they are fast but somewhat short-ranged vessels."
RUS_destroyer_3:0 "Soobrazitelnyi Class"
RUS_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Soobrazitelnyi destroyers are an improved version of the previous Gnevny class. Their engines are redesigned and they have a stronger AA armament. They weigh between 1,900 and 2,400 tons, and their speed and range are similar to the Gnevny class."
RUS_destroyer_4:0 "Skoryi Class"
RUS_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Skoryi class is a further improvement on the Soobrazitelnyi class. The increase in size and weight (2,500-3,100 tons) results in a more stable ship with an increased operational range. All ships are built as a modular design that results in rapid construction and deployment times. Their armament is the same as that of the previous Soobrazitelnyi class, but the main guns are housed in twin turrets instead of single turrets."

RUS_light_cruiser_1:0 "Svetlana Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Svetlana class cruiser, had her construction started before WWI but the war and the following revolution and civil war delayed the completion of the entire class. In the mid-late 1920's, she was finally commissioned for the Russian Navy along with her half-sister Rurik. Those vessels were the first turbine-driven cruisers of the Russian Navy. They are heavily armed and well-armored cruisers for ships of their time."
RUS_light_cruiser_2:0 "Ruslan Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Ruslan class light cruisers are a series of vessels, which are somewhat of a mix of older and more recent technologies. Using hulls of the Svetlana and Admiral Nakhimov classes as a base for the new project, the ship's construction costs were reduced. Equipped with six twin turrets of smaller, destroyer caliber guns and a decent AA armament they are suited for scouting and a destroyer flotilla leader role. The overall look of the ships bears similarities with the Oleg class cruisers."
RUS_light_cruiser_3:0 "Kazarsky Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Kazarsky class cruisers are based on the Oleg class cruisers and are included in the 1937-1943 shipbuilding program. As the first true modern light cruiser of the Russian navy, they carry a strong anti-surface and anti-air armament together with a decent torpedo armament. Overall, those are good ships with a thick armor, high speed, a good operational range, and a weight between 10,500 and 14,000 tons."
RUS_light_cruiser_4:0 "Moskva Class"
RUS_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Moskva class cruisers are the most numerous cruisers of the Russian Navy and are improved versions of the preceding Kazarsky class. Compared to the Kazarsky's, they have the same armament, machinery and armor, but have an increased fuel capacity allowing for a bigger range, improved submarine protection, an increased anti-aircraft battery, and a slightly better manoeuvrability. They are designed for the roles of convoy hunting and capital ship escorts."

### OTT – Ottoman Empire ###

OTT_battle_cruiser_pre:1 "Yavuz Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Yavuz-class is a licenced copy of the German Moltke-class battlecruisers. During the Weltkrieg, the Moltke-class SMS Goeben was transferred to the Ottoman Navy and renamed the Yavuz Sultan Selim, effectively founding the class. After the war, the Ottomans purchased a licence to produce additional Yavuz-class battlecruisers.

OTT_battle_cruiser_1:1 "Fatih Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Fatih-class is a fairly typical battlecruiser of the post-Weltkrieg era. It is heavily based on the preceding Yavuz-class, with the twin wing turrets replaced by a second superfiring front turret, allowing the same weight of fire in a broadside volley while saving significant weight."
 
OTT_battle_cruiser_2:1 "Kanuni Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Kanuni-class was designed with economy in mind, given the Empire's increasing economic difficulties. Wherever possible, non-critical elements were to be made from cheaper materials, and many crew conveniences were reduced or deleted. Nonetheless, the combat capabilities of the Kanuni-class were not skimped on, and it is easily in the same league as modern battlecruisers in foreign navies."

OTT_battle_cruiser_3:1 "Genç Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the sacrifices made in the design of the Kanuni-class led to widespread discontent and borderline mutiny among naval personnel, and the more frequent maintenance and replacement of substandard parts negated the initial cost savings, the Genç-class abandoned the idea of being as cheap as possible. It is an ambitious design that incorporates many examples of modern, cutting-edge technology, so despite having broadside volley firepower no better than the Kanuni- or Fatih-class designs, heavy-duty autoloaders grant it a reload rate almost on par with that of a heavy cruiser, granting it significant overall firepower."

OTT_battle_cruiser_4:1 "Yıldırım Class"
OTT_battle_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Yıldırım-class is in some ways more conservative than the preceding Genç. It abandons the 28cm guns used by all Turkish battlecruisers up to this point, even with the powerful, but temperamental autoloaders used on the Genç, in favour of significantly larger, battleship-grade models. Five double 40.6cm gun turrets do give it less overall firepower than modern battleships, and a lower rate of fire than with the smaller 28cm guns, but its high speed and maneuverability, and respectable belt armour, compensate for these shortcomings, making the Yildirim a fast, deadly warship."

OTT_battleship_pre:1 "Reşad Class"
OTT_battleship_pre_desc:1 "The Reşad-class battleships were designed during the Weltkrieg, and have undergone significant modernisation since. They are heavily armed and armoured, with six twin 30cm centerline turrets giving a heavy broadside, and 16 150mm casemate guns providing close protection, but this design limited the available room for extra AA weaponry that could be added during refits."

OTT_battleship_1:1 "Vatan Class"
OTT_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Vatan-class battleships were a pair of ships designed during the later stages of the Weltkrieg. After the Treaty of Versailles, their construction was put on hold, and after the Peace with Honour both partially completed vessels were scrapped. Their design was quite modern for the era, with four twin 40.6cm turrets providing a heavy broadside volley, 12 150mm casemate-mounted secondary guns, and another 10 77mm open gun mounts, which could also be used against aircraft."

OTT_battleship_2:1 "Devlet Class"
OTT_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Devlet-class is an iteration on the Vatan-class design, longer and wider to accommodate a fifth double turret, and with a reduced secondary casemate armament in favour of dual-purpose guns and small-calibre anti-aircraft turrets."

OTT_battleship_3:1 "Padişah Class"
OTT_battleship_3_desc:1 "The Padişah-class is a very modern battleship design, with three triple centerline turrets allowing for similar firepower to the Devlet-class in a shorter, more compact ship. Extra attention was given to the armour scheme and the torpedo protection, offering this ship excellent survivability. The casemate secondaries have been eliminated entirely, replaced by a larger number of 88mm dual-purpose guns."

OTT_battleship_4:1 "Hakan Class"
OTT_battleship_4_desc:1 "After the shortcomings of the Padishah-class became clear, the Hakan-class was designed as a significantly longer ship, granting room to bring back the 150mm secondary guns, this time mounted in twin turrets, four to a side. The 88mm guns have received magazine feeding systems, and with eight single mountings and six triple turrets, all centrally guided by radar fire control, they can project a withering amount of defensive anti-air and anti-destroyer firepower."

OTT_SH_battleship_1:1 "Hümayun Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_1_desc:1 "Designed to take and deal heavy punishment, the Hümayun-class is an extravagantly expensive battleship design, boasting the thickest hull armour in the Ottoman Navy, and a deadly broadside from its four triple 40.6cm turrets. Despite its heavy close-range secondary armament, consisting of casemate-mounted guns, dual-purpose 88mm guns, and a blistering array of autocannons, the Hümayun still needs to be properly escorted, or aerial and submarine threats will send her to the bottom."

OTT_SH_battleship_2:1 "Hanedan Class"
OTT_SH_battleship_2_desc:1 "The Hanedan-class is even larger and more powerful than the preceding Hümayun-class. She is a long, broad ship, barely able to pass through the Bosphorus, with a main armament of three triple 46cm gun turrets, two double 21cm secondary gun turrets, fourteen double 150mm dual-purpose turrets, and numerous magazine-fed single-mount and triple-turret 88mm guns, with one suite of radar fire control for the 46cm and 21cm guns and two additional ones for the smaller defensive armament. Despite all of this, her modern turbine engines make her faster than the Hümayun. As such, the papers have dubbed her the Sultan of the Seas."

OTT_carrier_pre:1 "Ertuğrul Class"
OTT_carrier_pre_desc:1 "After the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Navy recovered the wreckage of the British seaplane carrier HMS Ben-my-Chree, repaired and refitted her, and returned her to active duty in 1925. Her new name comes from the artillery officer, Mustafa Ertuğrul Pasha, whose battery sank her off at Kızılhisar. The recovered seaplanes, though too heavily damaged to be put back into service, and the aircraft handling mechanisms were studied particularly intently, both by the Ottoman Navy and the Air Force, providing a solid foundation on which to base further development of naval aviation."

OTT_carrier_1:1 "Ahmet Ali Class"
OTT_carrier_1_desc:1 "Named after the first black pilot in history, the naval aviator Izmirli Arap Ahmet Ali Pasha, this aircraft carrier design is the Ottoman Navy's effort to catch up with competing naval aviation efforts. It is armed with a 3cm Kuşçu AA gun, as well as several machine gun mounts, in order to defend itself against aerial threats."

OTT_carrier_2:1 "Valide Class"
OTT_carrier_2_desc:1 "The Valide-class is a much larger design than its predecessors, with larger hangar capacity and a longer runway. While it is still a conversion design, based on naval transport ships, its capabilities are broadly comparable to the older purpose-built carriers of other navies. It was initially designed with a large array of 3cm Kuşçu guns, but these outdated weapons have been scrapped in favour of several modern 88mm dual-purpose guns, capable of firing on nearby naval targets as well, and a number of more modern autocannon mounts. The engines of the transport ships converted to Valides are also replaced with modern steam turbine designs."

OTT_carrier_3:1 "Haseki Class"
OTT_carrier_3_desc:1 "The Haseki-class was originally planned as a seaplane carrier design, however it quickly became clear that this type of ship is no longer suitable for main-line use in a modern navy. Instead, the Valide-class conversion design was used as a base for a new purpose-built aircraft carrier, longer and more well-armoured than its predecessor, armed with a respectable number of 88mm UçakSav guns, in addition to two experimental high-elevation dual-purpose 150mm gun mounts."

OTT_carrier_4:1 "Hatun Class"
OTT_carrier_4_desc:1 "The Hatun-class is the most advanced carrier ever designed for the Ottoman Navy. She is slightly longer than the Haseki-class, several metres taller, and almost twice as wide, giving her a significantly increased hangar capacity as well as a powerful armament suite of three twin dual-purpose 150mm gun turrets and six triple 88mm turrets. She also has provisions for installing the experimental Kulak radar array, which, when development is finished, will greatly increase her effective spotting range and gun direction."

OTT_submarine_pre:1 "Çanakkale Class"
OTT_submarine_pre_desc:1 "The first Çanakkale-class submarines were built in late WW1. These submarines have very good torpedo armament for their time, but their slightly underpowered engines and thin hull make them vulnerable."

OTT_submarine_1:1 "Abdülhamit Class"
OTT_submarine_1_desc:1 "The Abdülhamit-class submarines, named after sultan Abdülhamit II, are improved versions of the Çanakkale-class. This design was developed in the 1920s, fixing the problems that plagued its predecessor, while improving its attack capabilities with heavier, more modern torpedoes."

OTT_submarine_2:1 "Deniz Kızı Class"
OTT_submarine_2_desc:1 "The Deniz Kızı class breaks with the tradition of its predecessors by not focusing primarily on armament. It is a long, sleek design, with four frontal and two rear 533mm torpedo tubes, and a supercharged diesel engine that makes it one of the fastest submarine designs in the world at the time of its design."

OTT_submarine_3:1 "Ay Class"
OTT_submarine_3_desc:1 "Largely an iteration on the preceding Deniz Kızı-class, the Ay-class is essentially a fatter version of the former, with thicker hull plating ensuring greater survivability, an extra two bow torpedo tubes, and a deck-mounted 88mm gun. Despite all this increased mass, the larger internal space allows for a larger engine too, which means it isn't any slower than its predecessor."

OTT_submarine_4:1 "Oruç Reis Class"
OTT_submarine_4_desc:1 "The Oruç Reis-class is a fairly unremarkable design overall. A further iteration of existing submarine designs, improvements over the preceding Ay-class are mostly incremental. The addition of a more modern hydroacoustic sonar system built under licence improves its ability to hunt other submarines, at the cost of giving away its location to enemy submarines and destroyers when in use. Besides this, the biggest change is the enlargement of the torpedo tubes from 533mm to 610mm."

OTT_destroyer_pre:1 "Konstantiniyye Class"
OTT_destroyer_pre_desc:1 "The Konstantiniyye-class was a development of the Osman II-class destroyers, relying on the same small basic hull. The design incorporated features discovered on German destroyers used during World War I, including a lengthened forecastle with a break forming a well deck immediately forward of the bridge. This arrangement, apparently derived from contemporary torpedo boat practice, offered the advantage of a low, semi protected area for the forward torpedo tubes albeit at the cost of becoming awash in heavy seas. Initial problems with stability during high-speed turns were later corrected by widening the beam and bringing up the waterline."

OTT_destroyer_1:1 "Barbaros Class"
OTT_destroyer_1_desc:1 "The Barbaros-class is a fairly standard late Weltkrieg destroyer design, with a light armament of three 77mm guns, a twin 533mm torpedo tube mounted in the well deck, and two more mounted further back, on the ship's centerline. Powerful turbine engines give it a high top speed. However, as with all destroyers, its armour protection is practically nonexistent."

OTT_destroyer_2:1 "Saffet Class"
OTT_destroyer_2_desc:1 "Named after the captain of the torpedo boat that sank HMS Goliath during the Weltkrieg, the Saffet-class is designed as more of a gunboat, with two triple centerline 533mm torpedo tubes but four twin 77mm guns on rapid motorised mounts. As destroyers go, it is a fairly compact design, intended for fast maneuvers at high speed."

OTT_destroyer_3:1 "Tatar Ramazan Class"
OTT_destroyer_3_desc:1 "While the Saffet-class may have been a strong design for hunting other destroyers, its smaller torpedo armament compared to its contemporaries limited its overall usefulness. As such, the Tatar Ramazan-class has cut back on the number of guns, being only three single 88mm guns this time, but three triple centerline 610mm torpedo tubes firing extended-range torpedoes, and a lengthened rear deck with additional depth charge launchers compared to the Saffet-class."

OTT_destroyer_4:1 "Piri Reis Class"
OTT_destroyer_4_desc:1 "The Piri Reis-class is a modern design, featuring fully enclosed motorised high-elevation dual-purpose turrets for its three 88mm guns, and five triple torpedo launchers. With one mounted behind the wheelhouse, and two on each side of the ship's midsection, it cannot get all its torpedoes in the water against a single target without heavy maneuvering, but it can carry more of them than other destroyers of similar size with centerline launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_pre:1 "Midilli Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "Originally Magdeburg-class light cruisers transferred from the German Hochseeflotte, starting with SMS Breslau, renamed Midilli. These ships' lighter armament than other contemporary cruisers, consisting of 12 105mm guns, was replaced with a more standard arrangement of 8 150mm guns in Ottoman service. Their small size and high speed made them useful as scout cruisers and blockade runners."

OTT_light_cruiser_1:1 "Kıbrıs Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Kıbrıs-class scout cruisers are late Weltkrieg designs intended for tracking Entente fleet movements in the Mediterranean and engaging targets of opportunity. To that end, they carried a fairly light 150mm gun armament, relying more on six twin side-mounted torpedo tubes for engaging any serious threats that they could not simply run away from. Their high-powered engines are maintenance-intensive, but they grant these ships a high cruise speed, and they can be pushed to their limits for brief periods if a rapid escape is called for."

OTT_light_cruiser_2:1 "Rodos Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_2_desc:1 "As land-based naval bombers and carrier-based naval aviation has become more and more common after the Weltkrieg, the Rodos-class was designed with an anti-air escort role in mind. Their primary armament is limited to six 150mm gun mounts, but they also carry ten high-elevation dual-purpose 77mm gun mounts and numerous autocannons and machine guns. Should they need to engage heavier surface ships, they can also still use their two triple torpedo launchers."

OTT_light_cruiser_3:1 "Girit Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_3_desc:1 "After the lessons of the Rodos-class, the Girit-class carries significantly more surface-to-surface firepower. However, as the main role of these ships is still anti-air, it only carries three twin 150mm turrets, with the remaining eight guns in somewhat outdated casemate mounts on the side of the ship. This leaves room on the deck and superstructure for four fully-enclosed motorised twin 88mm dual-purpose turrets and six more single 88mm gun mounts. Provisions are also made for mounting an air detection radar."

OTT_light_cruiser_4:1 "Malta Class"
OTT_light_cruiser_4_desc:1 "With naval aviation becoming more prominent, and battleship anti-air suites more powerful, the role of the light cruiser as primarily an anti-air escort ship appears to be over. The Malta-class still carries potent anti-air firepower, helped by the fact that its main 150mm armament is now also mounted in dual-purpose turrets, but its torpedo armament has also been significantly expanded in order to expand its role as an agile anti-surface combatant. Two quadruple torpedo launchers on each side complement five twin 150mm gun turrets and two triple 88mm turrets, with the usual autocannons rounding out its armament."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre:1 "Selim Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_pre_desc:1 "The Selim-class is a heavy armoured cruiser design intended to accompany battleships in the battle line and engage smaller surface combatants like cruisers and destroyers while the capital ships slug it out. It carries a mixed primary armament of four 21cm guns, six 150mm guns, and eight 77mm guns. Its low speed is compensated for by its thick armour protection, allowing it to stand up to several battleship-calibre hits."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_1:1 "Sokullu Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:1 "The Sokullu-class is a modern design for its time, carrying its eight main 21cm guns in four fully-enclosed superfiring turrets. However, despite carrying fewer smaller guns, this increased weight allocated to the armament means it does not boast armour as heavy as the Selim-class."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_2:1 "Köprülü Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:1 "The Köprülü-class was designed to bring heavy firepower to bear at a budget. It is small for a heavy cruiser, and carries lighter armament than most others, in the form of three double 21cm turrets and four enclosed 150mm turrets, but this lowers its displacement enough compared to other contemporary heavy cruisers that its speed, maneuverability, and armour are all above average, while the cost stays relatively low."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_3:1 "Kırım Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:1 "More modern manufacturing techniques and assembly line construction allow the Kırım-class heavy cruisers to remain relatively low-cost, like their predecessor design, while offering increased combat capabilities. Five double 21cm turrets give it a very heavy broadside, but the awkward gun arrangement, with one forward turret, two superfiring rear turrets, and the remaining two turrets mounted amidships between the superstructure, means it has to fully expose its vulnerable side armour in order to get all guns firing at the same target."

OTT_heavy_cruiser_4:1 "Giray Class"
OTT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:1 "The Giray-class does away with its predecessor's undesirable turret arrangement and instead uses three triple 21cm turrets to provide similar weight of fire in a more convenient manner. The addition of two of the new twin 150mm dual-purpose turrets significantly improve its anti-air firepower."
