integrate_china_desc:0 "We only need one government. Although we have bested threats on battlefield, a set of campaigns to dismantle the support bases of our rivals, to seize their assets, and abrogate their treaty ports will be necessary to ensure our future peace. Our government has reclaimed territories that belongs to our former enemy. Establishing local administrations is critical to our future success.[GetIntegrateChina]"

### Army Reform

Soldiers are notoriously poorly trained and disorderly, often recruited from a varied stock of bandits, petty criminals, and the chronically destitute. Equipment is regularly patchwork, obsolete, or even downright archaic. Loyalty is typically given to individual officers, or a regularly filled ricebowl, and ideological motivation is ephemeral at best. It will take a great deal to rebuild these armies along modern lines."

Overcoming these decades of neglect will take time and effort, and the performance of our forces will suffer until we do so.§!"

We will be sipping Sake amid the ruins of their headquarters by the end of the year." #Japanese POV
