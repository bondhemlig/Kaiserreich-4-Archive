### Focus ###
 SAF_crysis:0 "Political Effort"
 SAF_crysis_desc:0 "To bring about change in the world, we need to be able to bring about change in our own country. Strengthening our political position should come first."
 SAF_protectorates:0 "Status of the Protectorates"
 SAF_protectorates_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the issue of natives within our traditional borders, we should address the status of the former British protectorates of Bechuanaland, Basotuland and Swaziland. While South Rhodesia was integrated as the fifth province of our Union because of its white population, the protectorates (High Commission Territories as they were reffered to under British control) were kept as they were before 1925 and governed by South African Commissioners in conjunction with local rulers."
 SAF_paramount_chiefs:0 "Extent of Native Autonomy"
 SAF_paramount_chiefs_desc:0 "We have decided to grant autonomy to the local rulers of the former High Commission Territories, the new Paramount Chiefs of the respective ethnic groups (the Tswana in Bechuanaland, the Basotho in Basotuland amd the Swazi in Swaziland)."
 SAF_chiefs_local:0 "Local Development of the Native Provinces"
 SAF_chiefs_local_desc:0 "The increased autonomy under their own native rulers has seen increased economic opportunity for Africans within the former HCTs. But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - it's limited to within the borders of the former HCT."
 SAF_chiefs_full:0 "Full Development of the Native Provinces"
 SAF_chiefs_full_desc:0 "The increased autonomy under their own native rulers has seen increased economic opportunity for Africans within the former HCTs. But we need to clarify the extent of the Chiefs power - it's encompass all of their peoples throughout South Africa."
 SAF_personal_forces:0 "Personal Forces of the Paramount Chiefs"
 SAF_personal_forces_desc:0 "Given the increased autonomy of the Paramount Chiefs, some of them are asking to be allowed to raise their own forces comprised of their respective tribesmen - to better secure their own positions. While arming natives is an unpalatable prospect, it reduces the strain upon the Union's armed forces to defend our borders."
 SAF_askari:0 "Askari Corps for the Union"
 SAF_askari_desc:0 "Now that we have armed certain ethnic groups, hawks in the Volksraad are suggesting that we raise our own native units, ones that would be loyal not to the Paramount Chiefs but to the Union."
 SAF_nuweveld:0 "Nuweveld Settlements"
 SAF_nuweveld_desc:0 "Our descsion to annex the High Commission Territories and turn them over to white settlers has seen the establishment of new settlements throught the Nuweveld. A new generation of Boers have taken these lands as their own. Locals are unhappy to lose access to the best agricultural land though and many have been forced to migrate to the cities for work as transient labour."
 SAF_native_rights:0 "Native Rights"
 SAF_native_rights_desc:0 "The government of the German Freistaat has begun to industrialise the Kaiserreich's African colonial holding. They are doing this by repealing the rights of the natives their and using them as forced labour to power their construction projects. Fearful of losing South Africa's industrial edge over the Germans to the north, the right wing of the party has proposed that we adopt similar measures here in the Union and embark upon our own project of industrial expansion."
 SAF_native_labour:0 "Native Labour in the Nuweveld"
 SAF_native_labour_desc:0 "Since the moderate repeal of the restrictions upon using the native population as forced labour, this has allowed our settlements in the Nuweveld to increase their productivity and better develop the regions."
 SAF_native_infrastructure:0 "Native Labour in the Protectorates"
 SAF_native_infrastructure_desc:0 "As part of the effort to keep up with the Freistaat, we have used the new reserves of native labour to expand South Africa's infrastructure."
 SAF_gesuiwerde_plan:0 "Forced Labour in the Nuweveld"
 SAF_gesuiwerde_plan_desc:0 "Since the repeal of the restrictions upon using the native population as forced labour, this has allowed our settlements in the Nuweveld to increase their productivity and better develop the regions."
 SAF_gesuiwerde_ifrastructure:0 "The Kariba Dam"
 SAF_gesuiwerde_ifrastructure_desc:0 "Plans for a hydro-electric dam on the Zambezi have up till now been ruled out as cost prohibitive, but with the new access to local native labour plans can go ahead."
 SAF_gesuiwerde_mines:0 "South Africa's Mines"
 SAF_gesuiwerde_mines_desc:0 "As part of the effort to keep up with the Freistaat, we have used the new reserves of native labour to expand South Africa's mining capacity."
 SAF_gesuiwerde_steelworks:0 "Vanderbijlpark's Steelworks"
 SAF_gesuiwerde_steelworks_desc: "As part of the effort to keep up with the Freistaat, we have used the new reserves of native labour to expand South Africa's steel production, with a new large facility at Vanderbijlpark."
 SAF_gesuiwerde_dam:0 "Construction of Kariba Dam finished"
 SAF_gesuiwerde_dam_desc:0 "After long and ardous work we have finished construction of the new grand Kariba Dam, which will provide enough energy for our expanding industry in Rhodesia."
 SAF_national_recovery_plan:0 "National Recovery Plan"
 SAF_national_recovery_plan_desc:0 "We must now move to resolve the economic crisis in out nation brought on by the global crash."
 SAF_industrialisation:0 "Industrialisation"
 SAF_industrialisation_desc:0 "The Gesuiwerde are pushing for increased industrialisation but the cost at this stage could be prohibitive."
 SAF_witwatersrand:0 "Begin with Witwatersrand"
 SAF_witwatersrand_desc:0 "We have begun our efforts to further industrialise our nation. Throught the Witwatersrand region roads have been built, railway track laid and new steel mills constructed bringing thousands back into the workforce."
 SAF_new_mines:0 "Open new mines"
 SAF_new_mines_desc:0 "Industialisation continues at an impressive pace. New mines are opening every month across the Orange Free State and the Transvaal. The roads of Johannesburg and Pretoria the equal of any European city. But there is noise coming from the provicial councils of the Cape and Natal, as well as the Dominionists in the Volksraad. They claim that the British provinces are being left behind, that our program is unfairly weighted towards the Afrikaans speaking areas. "
 SAF_complete_industrialisation:0 "Economic Recovery Complete!"
 SAF_complete_industrialisation_desc:0 "Almost two years after Black Monday plunged our nation and the world into chaos, we have come back from the brink and have returned our economy to pre crash levels! While we have solidified our status as the most industrialised nation in Africa, the cost has been severe - both financially and socially. Our focus upon the former Boer republics has left a bitter tase in the mouths of the British provinces, who are still seeing high levels of unemployed, as many must become migrant workers in the interior."
 SAF_detente:0 "Détente"
 SAF_detente_desc:0 "In an effort to bring our economy back from the crash brought on by our trade with Germany, we have decided that we must look towards the old Empire for new trade opportunities. It is hoped that in so doing, British investment will create job opportunities for South Africa's unemployed."
 SAF_new_docks:0 "Entente investments in ports"
 SAF_new_docks_desc:0 "Since we improved relations with the Entente, Britsh and French capital has poured into our country, with private firms taking the initiative and investing in new docks in Durban and Port Elizabeth to ease congestion at Capetown and many miles of train track laid thoughout the Cape."
 SAF_kimberly_mines:0 "Entente investments in Kimberly"
 SAF_kimberly_mines_desc:0 "The influx of capital continues to grow our economy. New mines have been set up in Kimberly, but some members of the Gesuiwerde and even some within our own have spoken out against the focus upon the British dominated parts of the country, while the Afrikaans OFS and Transvaal receive very little investment."
 SAF_complete_detente:0 "Economic Recovery Complete!"
 SAF_complete_detente_desc:0 "Almost two years after Black Monday plunged our nation and the world into chaos, we have come back from the brink and have returned our economy to pre crash levels! However, the OFS and the Transvaal seem to have been left behind. Unemployment there is still a problem, with most of the jobs created have been in the Cape, and these have gone to Coloured or native workers."
 SAF_work_programs:0 "General Work Program"
 SAF_work_programs_desc:0 "The majority of the party is in support of a general work program for the unemployed, the idea being this will get our economy back on it's feet again."
 SAF_new_roads:0 "Build new roads"
 SAF_new_roads_desc:0 "Our efforts to get the unemployed back into work have begun to take effect, with new roads being constructed in the OFS, Transvaal and Cape provinces."
 SAF_orange_river_mines:0 "Open new mines"

 SAF_complete_work_programs:0 "Economic Recovery Complete!"
 SAF_complete_work_programs_desc:0 "Almost two years after Black Monday plunged our nation and the world into chaos, we have come back from the brink and have returned our economy to pre crash levels!

 SAF_extra_slot:0 "Extra Research Slot"
 SAF_extra_slot_desc:0 "Our industrial expansion and other recent advances might allow us to conduct more R&D in parallel."

### Event text ###
 SAF.1.t:0 "Black Monday hits South Africa!"
 SAF.1.d:0 "On the 3rd of February, the German stock market collapsed, plunging the world into depression. South Africa has relied on trade with Germany and its sphere of influence since the British Revolution and the decleration of the South African republic and withdrawl from trade with the remaining Entente. The crisis has had a terrible effect upon the South African economy, unemployment has risen markedly as many companies that depended upon the German export market go out of business or lay off white workers in favour of native labour."
 SAF.1.a:0 "This is a disaster!"
 SAF.2.t:0 "Dealing with the crisis."
 SAF.2.d:0 "The global economic crisis has hit South Africa hard. Our dependence on trade with Germany, long criticised by the pro British Dominion Party has seen deepening hardship take hold. However, the Volksraad is divided on how best to deal with the crisis. Cheap native labour is seen by many as the chief cause of unemployment and both the National Party and South African Labour Party are calling for further restrictions to be made upon native employment. The National Party also view an ambitious works program and an explotation of the Protectorates could aleviate the sitution while SA Labour feel socio-economic reform is key at this time. The Dominion Party points again to the dependence on Germany and seeks a liberalisation of the economy and a resumption of ties with the Entente and the Empire, although large tracts of Afrikaner society would balk at the prospect."
 SAF.2.a:0 "The National Party will solve this crisis alone."
 SAF.2.b:0 "We can work with our old coalition partners, Labour."
 SAF.2.c:0 "Co-opearate with the Dominionists..."
 SAF.3.t:0 "The National Party Splits"
 SAF.3.d:0 "Unwilling to compromise their values, the more extreme wing of the National Party led by Daniel François Malan has broken away to form the 'Gesuiwerde' or Purified National Party. They reject any compromise with either the British or the reds and believe that the best way to ensure the future of South Africa is to strengthen and expand the existing provincial segregation laws into a full nation-wide system, termed 'apartheid'."
 SAF.3.a:0 "Oh dear!"
 
 ### SACW Event text ###
 SACW.1.t:0 "The Port Elizabeth Decleration"
 SACW.1.d:0 "Today in Port Elizabeth the leading figures of the Dominion Party, General Jan C Smuts and Jan Hofmeyer, along with the provincial governors of the Cape, Natal and Rhodesia met to discuss the coming election in May. An agreement has been reached now that support for the Dominion Party and dissatifaction with the ruling Nationalist govt has reached the point where the pro British faction could form the next administration. To that end, they have issued a decleration, stating their intent to reform the Union of South Africa into a new more liberal Federation and to pursue a reconciliation with the British Empire."
 SACW.1.a:0 "Hmmm..."
 
 SACW.2.t:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa Election"
 SACW.2.d:0 "The 1938 Union of South Africa General Election has transformed into a referendum on the country's future. Either the Nationalists will retain control of the Volksraad and set about solidifying white - Afrikaner rule through a full system of Apartheid or they will be defeated by the Dominion Party who will move to enact the Port Elizabeth Decleration and the formation of a new federal South Africa. In what is likely to become the most important election in the nations history, tensions are running high as reports of violent incidents througout the country increase with each passing day."
 SACW.2.a:0 "The National Party"
 SACW.2.b:0 "The Dominion Party"
 
 SACW.3.t:0 "The Nationalist Government"
 SACW.3.d:0 "The National Party has seen off the chalange by Smut's Dominionists. However, the election was dangerously close, the Nationalists only having a razor thin majority in the Volksraad. One of the more noticable feature was that all of the representatives for natives were Dominionists and the Coloured vote was overwhelmingly pro British. The hawks are saying we should move immediately to severe the political ties between the races in the Union of South Africa once and for all by finally bringing into existence Apartheid. The atmosphere is dangerous though and any rash moves could well be met by resitance."
 SACW.3.a:0 "Begin the process of Apartheid!"
 SACW.3.b:0 "Now is not the time..."
 
 SACW.4.t:0 "The Dominionist Government"
 SACW.4.d:0 "The Dominion Party has finally defeated the pro Afrikaner Nationalist Party and gained control of the Volksraad. However, the election was dangerously close, the Dominionist majority being razor thin. While gains were limited in Afrikaner dominated areas, native and coloured voters have overwhelmingly endorced our proposed federal model. Should we push ahead and declare the end of the old Union and the start of the new South African Federation? Or should we wait until the climate is less hostile, as any rash move now could be met with resistance."
 SACW.4.a:0 "Declare the start of a new Federation!"
 SACW.4.b:0 "Impliment change gradually..."
 
 SACW.5.t:0 "Construction of the Voortrekker Monument"
 SACW.5.d:0 "Begun in 1935, construction of the Voortrekker Monument is nearing completion. Situated in Pretoria, it commemorates the Voortrekkers who left the Cape Colony between 1835 and 1854 to found the Afrikaner republics of the interior. Costs however continue to grow, but we are on scheduale to open the Monument at the Centenary celebrations next year."
 SACW.5.a:0 "It will be a lasting legacy!"
 
 SACW.6.t:0 "Preperations for the Centenary Celebrations"
 SACW.6.d:0 "The Centenial Anniversary of the Great Trek is little under a month away. The centenary celebrations are planned to commence with a re-enactment of the trek beginning on 8 August 1938 with nine ox wagons at the statue of Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and end at the newly completed Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, at which time the Monument shall be inaugurated by the President. The whole affair is meant to be a celebration of Afrikaner culture and heritage, but the situation in the country has changed, and such a lavish event could very well be met with open hostility by the other racial groups who are likely to see it as a display of triumphalism. Shall we continue as planned or adopt a more modest approach?"
 SACW.6.a:0 "It will go ahead as planned!"
 SACW.6.b:0 "Perhaps a more modest approach is best..."
 
 SACW.7.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
 SACW.7.d:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. While the ceremony proceeded without incident, the atmosphere was of a subdued nature in Cape Town as the reenactment departed."
 SACW.7.a:0 "Could have been worse..."
 
 SACW.8.t:0 "Innauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
 SACW.8.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that unity was needed in these troubled times to preserve the Union of South Africa. The ceremony was a more reserved affair than many had expected, but the lack of any hostilities in response was a welcome relief for the government."
 SACW.8.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 
 SACW.9.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
 SACW.9.d:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. Unfortunately large numbers of British and Coloureds attended the ceremony in protest, with attempts being made to impede the procession until police cleared a path. However one of the wagons was destroyed and several of the participants injured."
 SACW.9.a:0 "Oh Dear!"
 
 SACW.10.t:0 "The Cape Town Riots"
 SACW.10.d:0 "The Voortrek protests have grown and got out of hand as Cape Town has descended into chaos. Riots sweep the city, targeting symbols of Afrikaner history and culture, such as the statue of Jan van Riebeeck, which has been torn down. The police and army units stationed nearbye are doing very little in the way of preventing these outrages."
 SACW.10.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 
 SACW.11.t:0 "ISL Mineworkers Strike"
 SACW.11.d:0 "The Syndicalist ISL has encouraged the mine workers of the Orange Free State to go on strike. Attempts to break the strike were met with resistance, with deaths on both sides. The industrial unrest looks set to spread into the Traansval as well now."
 SACW.11.a:0 "Red bastards!"
 
 SACW.12.t:0 "Innauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
 SACW.12.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has finally arrived in Pretoria. President Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that the Afrikaner nation must stand together to preserve its way of life and that he would never surrender the Union of South Africa to either the Briton or the native. The ceremony was an extravagent affair, with tens of thousands attending. Pretoria and Johannesburg have been gripped in a nationalist frenzy, with incidents of violence being committed against British and native residents."
 SACW.12.a:0 "We are proud Afrikaners!"
 
 SACW.13.t:0 "The Natal Covenant"
 SACW.13.d:0 "In resonse to Hertzog's speech in Pretoria, today in Durban City Hall the provincial governor and council have declared their secession from the Union of South Africa. The have drawn up a document refferred to as 'the Natal Covenant' which states that they are loyal supporters of the British Empire and as such will never support our republic. Thousands of Natalians have signed the document and the governors and councils of Rhodesia and the Cape have declared their support of it as well."
 SACW.13.a:0 "If it's a fight they want..."
 
 SACW.14.t:0 "The End of the Union?"
 SACW.14.d:0 "Now that fully three of the five provinces of the Union of South Africa are in open revolt, there are calls for us to renounce the fraying mantle of the Union, itself an imperialist anachronism. Instead they advise we should restore the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, but perhaps that is a step too far?"
 SACW.14.a:0 "No we will preserve the Union!"
 SACW.14.b:0 "Restore the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek!"
 
 SACW.15.t:0 "Preperations for the Centenary Celebrations"
 SACW.15.d:0 "The Centenial Anniversary of the Great Trek is little under a month away. The centenary celebrations were planned by the previous government to commence with a re-enactment of the trek beginning on 8 August 1938 with nine ox wagons at the statue of Jan van Riebeeck in Cape Town and end at the newly completed Voortrekker Monument in Pretoria, at which time the Monument was to be inaugurated by the President. The whole affair was meant to be a celebration of Afrikaner culture and heritage, but the situation in the country has changed, we could allow it to proceed as planned or we could reign in the scale of the events so as not to be seen as pandering to the Afrikaners."
 SACW.15.a:0 "It will go ahead as planned!"
 SACW.15.b:0 "They'll have to make do with less"
 
 SACW.16.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
 SACW.16.d:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. While the ceremony proceeded without incident, the atmosphere was strained in Cape Town as the reenactment departed."

 SACW.17.t:0 "Innauguration of the Voortrekker Monument"
 SACW.17.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has arrived in Pretoria. President Smuts addressed the crowd, saying that unity was needed and that the rights of the Afrikaner community would be respected as we move forwards to federalism. The ceremony was a success, despite protests by the Afrikaner Broederbond and other nationalist groups."
 SACW.17.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 
 SACW.18.t:0 "100th Anniversary of the Great Trek"
 SACW.18.d:0 "One hundred years ago today, our ancestors set out from the Cape, seeking life land and liberty free from British domination. The ceremony was lacklustre, the poor funding evident. This was offset however by the large turnout of Afrikaners from other parts of South Africa to take part, including a group calling themselves the Ossewabrandwag (Ox-Wagon Sentinels). Unfortunately this militia of sorts clashed with local police who struggled to handle the larger than expected turnout. With violence escalting the police tried to bring the procession and disperse the reenactors which resulted in shots being exchanged, killing 3 policemen and 17 Ossewabrandwag with many more reenactors and bystanders injured."
 SACW.18.a:0 "Oh Dear!"
 
 SACW.19.t:0 "The Ossewabrandwag Riots"
 SACW.19.d:0 "Throughout the former Boer Republics branches of the Ossewabrandwag have formed and have begun to organise protests against our government, many of them descending into rioting. The Afrikaner nationalists target natives and Britons alike as they view these groups as collaborating against them to destroy Afrikaner culture. Police and military units stationed nearbye have been reluctant to intervene and have done little to end the violence."
 SACW.19.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 
 SACW.20.t:0 "ISL Mineworkers Strike"

 SACW.21.d:0 "The reenactment of the Great Trek that left Cape Town 2 weeks ago has finally arrived in Pretoria. President Smuts was unable to attend as it constituted a security risk. Instead, ex-president Hertzog addressed the crowd, saying that the Afrikaner nation must stand together to preserve its way of life and that he would never surrender the Union of South Africa to either the Briton or the native. The ceremony was an much expanded affair due to OssewaBrandwag contributions, with tens of thousands attending. Pretoria and Johannesburg have been gripped in a nationalist frenzy, with incidents of violence being committed against British and native residents."

 SACW.22.d:0 "The provincial governors of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State have declared their secession from the Union of South Africa and have formed together the 2nd Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and named Hertzog their President.

 SACW.25.d:0 "Forces loyal to the ex president Hertzog, have launched a coup with the aim of seizing control of the country and reversing our attempts at federalisation. While successful in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, where they met little resistance and were joined by local military units - elesewhere they made sparse progress. In Cape Town, militants of the Ossewabrandwag tried to occupy the Parliament but were repulsed by the guards stationed there and a rapidly formed militia which drove them from the city. The provincial governors of both the Transvaal and the Orange Free State have declared their secession from the South African Federation and have formed together the 2nd Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek and named Hertzog their president."
