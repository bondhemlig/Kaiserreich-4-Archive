 worldnews.1.t:0 "The Second American Civil War"
 worldnews.1.d:0 "To uneducated foreigners, it might seem like the crisis in the United States happened out of nowhere, but experts agree that this was a civil war years in making. Ever since the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange in 1929, the economy of the United States has been in constant downturn. \nNow, the United States has devolved into a three-way civil war between the loyalists of the old government, the syndicalist Combined Syndicates of America and the conservative and xenophobic American Union State. There have already been reports of arriving volunteers from Europe to fight for a faction of their liking. The Second American Civil War might just be the first of the many battlefields between the great powers of the world in this tough time for humanity."

 worldnews.3.t:0 "The Second Russian Civil War"
 worldnews.3.d:0 "Mere 20 years ago, in the last years of the Weltkrieg, the Russian Empire collapsed in turmoil, ripped apart between nationalist movements, the Whites and the Reds. After a German intervention, the republican government defeated the Bolsheviks, but it appears that the Russian revolutionary spirit was not extinguished. \n\nAfter ineffective land reform by the Kerensky government and austerity measures to pay off the Brest-Litovsk reparations, as well as a crisis in the government after the President's assassination, the cities in the western part of the nation have been engulfed with the Red tide once more. Will Bukharin's Soviet Russia prevail, or will the loyalists of the White government defeat the dissenters a second time?"

 worldnews.4.t:0 "The Spanish Civil War"
 worldnews.4.d:0 "Ever since the defeat of Napoleon, Spain has been plagued by violence, dissent and turmoil, but it appears that these tensions have reached a breaking point. That is, the Spanish kingdom has been ripped apart in a three-sided civil war between numerous factions - the loyalists of the Madrid government, the supporters of the pretender Javier and finally the anarcho-syndicalist party known as the CNT-FAI. There are already numerous reports of volunteers and equipment being shipped to Spain from all over the world to support one faction or another. \n\nIt can be safely said that the fields and mountains of Spain will be the first battlefield of a much wider conflict between the left and the right..."

 worldnews.5.t:0 "The Second Weltkrieg"
 worldnews.5.d:0 "The Weltkrieg is universally agreed to have been the most horrible war in human existence, but it appears that even the greatest nightmares cannot deter man's lust for blood. After numerous political struggles and periods of diplomatic tension, the uneasy peace between Germany and France has broken down. These two superpowers are now mobilizing their armies and preparing for a conflict never before seen to the human eye. \n\nThe military developments of the Interwar will be put to the ultimate test. New types of weapons, planes, artillery, ships and tanks will see their first usage in the battlefield. But who will emerge victorious? That is a question none can answer."

 worldnews.6.t:0 "The Damocles Project"
 worldnews.6.d:0 "German spies have recently revealed a mysterious, and in some ways horrifying project taken up by the French and British. Dubbed 'The Damocles Project', it is an extensive multi-nation study into the destructive power of nuclear fission, seeking to unearth any possible... weaponization possibilities of this phenomena. The famous German physicist Albert Einstein warns that a successful 'nuclear bomb' might even be able to turn entire cities into ash. \n\nGerman intelligence agencies have shared the information about this project to their closest allies, but most of the world is still left unaware of it. However, experts disagree on whether this weapon is feasible or if this is just science fiction gone too far."

 worldnews.7.d:0 "The Russian Republic, created in the last years of the Weltkrieg, appears to only have lasted 20 years before it's end. Plagued by disorder, conflict and ineffective governments, the Republic lost the support of the people, and Russian agencies now report that a successor of Nicholas II has been finally coronated as the new Tsar of the nation. \n\nWhile it is not known how different the international stance of this reborn Russian Empire will be, or even if the coronation of the Tsar will have any effect in 'saving the country', numerous monarchies across the world have already congratulated the Romanovs on regaining their divine birth right."

The government of the Russian nation has announced their territorial ambitions, laying claims on almost all the territory of the former Russian Empire. And it appears they are willing to reconquer the lost land if necessary. \n\nNumerous nations in Eastern Europe have already recalled their embassies in Russia, and the world is waiting for Germany's response to this blatant attack on her sphere of influence..."

The French Commune has invited numerous countries to the first official gathering of the members of the Third Internationale to discuss political, foreign matters and cooperate on spreading Socialism further. The French opened the International with a powerful parade, festivities in Paris and finally a speech by the Chairman of the CSP. \n\nTopics like Spain, the United States and the world economic crisis are at the top priority, and it's expected that France and Britain will take initiative in the gathering."

The Mongolian army has already defeated the Ma Clique and von Sternberg has declared his right to reign over all Mongolians numerous times before. Experts deny the possibility that the Mongolians could pose a threat to the established powers in the Far East, but the fresh Khan's ambition can only grow higher..."

 worldnews.11.d:0 "What started out as a mere incident caused by a show of force by the British socialist navy has now devolved into an outright war across the Atlantic. The Union of Britain has declared its goal of spreading Syndicalism to the nearby state of Ireland, which prompted an intervention by the exiled British royalist government in Canada. The navies and air forces of both belligerents are already being mobilized, and the first shots have already been fired in the Irish Sea. \n\nExperts believe that the intensity of this conflict will be limited due to the large bodies of water separating the belligerents, but it has nevertheless raised world tensions to new heights."

 worldnews.13.t:0 "E.M. Remark - Führerreich"
 worldnews.13.d:0 "The famous German writer, member of the Lost Generation poets, Erich Maria Remark has released a new book, the first major work of alternate history in the German Empire. \n\nThe story is a gripping tale about the life of a young Weltkrieg veteran trying to live in a shell-shocked and defeated Germany. In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and thus an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War and is coup by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler and his German Workers Party, who follow the ideology of 'People's Socialism', which is just an extreme version of National Populism. \n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's 'New Reich', the Western Entente and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. While many criticize it for large flaws in historical logic, Remarque defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

 worldnews.14.t:0 "Ignas Šeinius - The Red Flood"
 worldnews.14.d:0 "Ignas Šeinius, Lithuania's most famous impressionist writer, has recently published a new book, 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood) that has just breached Lithuania's prison in litreary obscurity. \n\nMuch like his famous 'Kuprelis', The Red Flood is a gripping impressionist tale about a love story between two young individuals in a divided country, but what is must interesting is the retting of the story. The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Brusilov Offensive was successful and knocked Austria-Hungary out of the Weltkrieg in 1916. This leads to a chain of events that result in an Entente victory. Germany is engulfed by revolution and becomes a Syndicalist nation, while Russia is coup by Kolchak, supported by the Black Hundreds, and becomes a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Europe is soon embroiled into war once more, and Lithuania becomes a front line, a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians, where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by the British Empire... \n\nThe book has been criticized for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

 worldnews.15.d:0 "Kerensky, has just been shot and killed while on the way to the Senate! The assailant was taken down by the police, but the goals and intentions of the attacker are unknown. Despite his massive unpopularity among the Russian people due to botched land reform and ineffective rule, Kerensky was nevertheless able to hold the country together for years, and his death has thrown Russia into chaos. The Senators are already discussing a possible replacement to Kerensky, new coalitions are being formed, both between the left and the right, while military men like Denikin, Wrangel and Kornilov are just one step away from intervening to dissolve democracy and 'save Mother Russia'..."

 worldnews.16.d:0 "After the Great South American War of the 1930s, two regional powers emerged in South America - Brazil and Argentina, the latter of whom later evolved into the 'federation' of La Plata. Tensions between these two giants, former enemies in the War now turned rivals for South American domination, have been rising for years, and a La Platan victory against Paraguay and Bolivia did little to ease them. \n\nThe fragile peace in South America has been finally broken with the beginning of an outright war between the two countries, a war that the weakened US will probably not be able to stop. While La Platans are confident in a second victory, Brazilians are ready to achieve revenge for their defeat last time..."

 worldnews.17.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
 worldnews.17.d:0 "The Arab Revolt in the Weltkrieg was a failure, mostly due to the defeat of the Entente, and the millions of Arabs living in the Levant and Iraq stayed under Ottoman rule. Despite this, though, Arab nationalism has been on the rise for many years, and it has finally culminated in the beginning of the Arab Congress in Cairo. Representatives from numerous Arabic nations were greeted with a spectacular performance by Egyptian dancers and an artillery salute, and the negotiations began. \n\nExperts predict that Egypt and Hashemite Arabia will lead the Congress, a Congress where bitterness towards the Ottomans and sometimes even discussions of a united Arab 'axis' against the Turks can flow freely."

 worldnews.18.d:0 "Serbia, Romania and Greece, the three Balkan members of the Entente, all with revanchist views of their own, have recently gathered to a common table of negotiations and recently announced the beginning of the Belgrade Pact. While this pact puts a lot of focus on cultural discussion and preserving Balkan identities, it is also a military alliance between the participants, seemingly directed at the country separating them and holding their 'ancestral lands'. \n\nThis new development is a big thorn in Bulgarian domination of the Balkans, but only the incoming reaction of the other Central Powers can determine whether it will yield any fruit."

 worldnews.19.d:0 "After the Weltkrieg, as the British Raj collapsed into turmoil and warfare, the neighbouring Kingdom of Afghanistan took advantage of this as an opportunity to seize Peshawar and Quetta, both border regions of the Dominion. However, the Afghani government's attempts to modernize over the last decades have been met with fierce resistance from the conservative elements within the country. King Amanullah Khan now hopes to use the turmoil in Delhi following the death of George V to his advantage. By repeating the success of the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War, the king hopes to silence the conservative opposition and bring new lands to the crown. However, international experts do not put many hopes on the tiny mountain nation winning this conflict."

President Herbert Hoover, whose administration has proven to be uncappable of stabilizing the divided country and calming down the CSA and AFP militants, has invited General Douglas MacArthur to take the reins of the country with a junta of military men and corporate representatives. \n\nPresident MacArthur is a strong proponent of an 'iron fist' rule and opposes both Syndicalism and American pacifism. Large-scale crackdowns on the 'enemies of America' have already been reported."
