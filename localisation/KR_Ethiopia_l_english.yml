ETH_Debt_idea_1_desc:0 "Our monumentally huge debt is truly crippling the state, to the point some even question our independence"
ETH_Debt_idea_2_desc:0 "While still massive and preventing us from doing large scale projects, our debt has diminished thanks to our efforts"
ETH_Debt_idea_3_desc:0 "While still large, and preventing us from doing taking several measures, our debt has substantially decreased thanks to our efforts"
ETH_Debt_idea_4_desc:0 "While still considerable, our debt is now fairly manageable, and limits us much less than it once did"
ETH_Debt_idea_5_desc:0 "Our debt has diminished to a nuisance; still, one that interferes in our long term goals somewhat"
ETH_military_Focus_desc:0 "Our main budgetary focus is the military, with its related expenses"
ETH_production_focus_desc:0 "Our main budgetary focus is production and industrial expansion"
ETH_construction_focus_desc:0 "Our main budgetary focus is expansion of our infrastructure and construction capabilities"
ETH_Tribal_Intergration_desc:0 "Tribes and chiefs had their rights recognised, and are much more loyal and helpful to state now"

ETH_Food_desc:0 "With the starvation issues solved, growth of population and the economy is projected in the medium term"
ETH_Scouts_desc:0 "Our youths now have a noble and admirable goal, and in the process they will become valued citizens of the Empire"
ETH_Slavery_idea_desc:0 "Slavery is an extremely widespread practice in Ethiopia. Despite token efforts by many Emperors since Menelik II, the slaves and their descendants still toil under pay less labour. This institution is not only inefficient, but a great source of shame abroad, for its not seen as something proper for a civilised nation in this day an age"
ETH_Land_Reform_idea_desc:0 "We are now using our lands efficiently and with modernised methods, greatly improving farming output"
ETH_Aristocratic_Army_desc:0 "In our army, station is determined by birth, and all relevant stations are held by soldiers whose competence is dubious at best, as shown in the Weltkrieg"
ETH_Speech_Freedom_desc:0 "We now have laws to protect freedom of speech and the political will to enforce those laws"
ETH_Ethiopian_Welfare_desc:0 "Poverty is more than something that takes lives, but takes prosperity from all citizens, even those who are doing well for themselves. We must protect the most fragile of our subject, to ensure all have a future"
ETH_Lion_of_Judah_idea_desc:0 "The Lion of Judah is more than a dynastic symbol. It stands for all the hardships and challenges that Ethiopia, the one nation to survive Colonialism and triumph twice against the colonisers, has overcome. Time and time again, in our thousand year history, the Empire stood tall since the Heirs of Solomon first set foot here"
ETH_Imperial_Inspiration_desc:0 "The Emperor is a man larger than life. To an untrained observer, he main seem like a meek, small man, but when he speaks, all listen. He inherited a broken, bankrupt empire from Zewditu, and now all can see what he stands for"
ETH_Working_Natives_desc:0 "Tribes and chiefs had their rights recognised, and are working more closely with us"
ETH_Trained_Pilots_desc:0 "Foreign advisers have been implemented a Piloting school in Adis Ababa"

ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_idea_desc:0 "By utilising foreign blueprints and expertise, we can ensure that we have Ethiopian guns made by Ethiopians for Ethiopians, which makes the whole ordeal a lot cheaper"
ETH_Levy_Army_desc:0 "The army of Ethiopia is not standing. Banners are called, and each lord summoned brings his troops, armed and loyal only to him... or refuses the call."

ETH_Nationalised_Railroad_desc:0 "The railroads will now be Imperial property, and we will take very good care of it."
ETH_Privatised_Railroad_desc:0 "The German railways will still be administered by capable German personnel, while still under closed watch by us "
ETH_Expand_Railroad_desc:0 "Expanding our railway system is vital to long term strategy. Lines of communication, distribution of goods and movement of troops; the Emperor knows the importance of the Train"
ETH_Southern_Expansion_desc:0 "The next step of our railway expansion project is to connect most of the southern regions of the Empire in our railway network"
ETH_Expand_Into_Eritrea_desc:0 "The next step of our railway expansion project is to include our coastal region of Eritrea, and improve prosperity and the flow of goods there"
ETH_Impose_Amharic_desc:0 "Eritrea is not ethnically homogenous, but it has a significantly sized Tigray elite which could be dangerous in the long run. We should take large steps to ensure that the language barrier is not to their advantage, and drive home the concept that Eritrea is Ethiopia"
ETH_Tribe_Intergration_desc:0 "The local leadership of Eritrea, especially among the most powerful local leaders, can be swayed to our side... for a price"
ETH_Officer_Intergration_desc:0 "Many veterans served under the Italians, and others under private militias since the Liberation. We should take steps to seamlessly integrate Eritrean forces into our military"
ETH_Construct_Naval_Base_desc:0 "Asamara will get a dockyard worthy of being the main port of a mighty Empire, thanks to our efforts. We will spare no expense!"
ETH_Intergration_Of_Eritrea_desc:0 "After 20 long years, Eritrean unrest has finally subsided, and people are finally taking notice of the good things the Empire brought since the Liberation. Serious unrest will end soon"
ETH_Develop_Eritrea_desc:0 "We will demonstrate that we are in good faith, and invest heavily into the region, unlike the Italian imperialists"
ETH_Invest_In_Industry_desc:0 "Industry is the way of the future. There is no going around it, the Empire needs factories!"
ETH_Tribal_Modernisation_desc:0 "Tribal groups and other small minorities shall have their rights guaranteed; as so to guarantee their obligations as well!"
ETH_Southern_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "We shall expand our industrialisation program southward, to better distribute profits and jobs from this new sector of the economy"
ETH_Military_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "Our army will need much better equipment; we will mass produce weapons and supplies needed to keep the empire safe"
ETH_German_Investment_desc:0 "Seeing our stability and loyalty, and seeking to combat the nefarious effects of Black Monday, Germany should perhaps take its investments abroad. Here, perhaps?"
ETH_German_Aid_desc:0 "Germany should not forget its allies; and it will not. Investors, private and from the Kaiser, will help bring Ethiopia back on track"
ETH_German_Military_Mission_desc:0 "German Military Mission"
ETH_Debt_desc:0 "Our national debt has spiralled out of control since the Weltkrieg. The sorely needed reforms by the empire cannot be made until that is dealt with"
ETH_Tax_Church_desc:0 "The church and the men bound to it must do their part to help our Empire better itself, even if they don't want to"
ETH_Tax_Slaveowners_desc:0 "Slave owners are very rich people, mostly. Perhaps we will make having slaves sightly more undesirable by increasing taxation on them, per slave. This will ruffle many feathers, but help our budget immensely"
ETH_Tax_Oromo_desc:0 "The Oromo people, in their isolation, have many privileges, which we will end in order to bring them in equal footing with the rest of the empire and improve our income"
ETH_Tax_Eritrea_desc:0 "The Eritreans were freed by us, and many alredy see themselves as Ethiopians. Its high time we taxed them and made them contribute to imperial prosperity as a whole"
ETH_Budget_desc:0 "We can finally have an adjusted budget, and indeed start the next step of the Emperor's grand plan: The Reforms"
ETH_Haile_desc:0 "Halie Selassie I is a reformer; a dynamic man who toured Europe and knows what is needed to bring Ethiopia to the 20th century. It will not be easy, but then again, easy ordeals are for smaller men than the King of Kings!"
ETH_Educate_Slaves_desc:0 "Now free, the slaves need to be properly integrated into our society. A perfect moment to expand school systems on all levels, we will ensure Ethiopia's future minds have more than toil in them"
ETH_Slavery_Question_desc:0 "Slavery simply does not belong in this day age. The concept of a man owning other man is not compatible with the Empire Halie envisions. Thankfully, our previous incentives in the form of tax raises mean that it would be actually cheaper to have workers than slaves, so the change would not be as radical as it could be. Much effort will be needed to heal the social and cultural wounds these oppressed folk have however"
ETH_Agriculture_Initative_desc:0 "We should ensure that we have a prosperous agricultural sector; the population of the Empire grows, and so should it's breadbasket, lest we overextend ourselves and start suffering from serious famines!"
ETH_Land_Reform_desc:0 "Land in Ethiopia is held in completely archaic means, usually the people who own the land do so through might and riches alone, and legal ownership is quite rare. It is time to reform the means of land ownership within Abyssinia, and there are a few ways we can do that:"
ETH_Modernise_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Our empire needs to abandon the Dark Ages of the Zemene Mesafint and truly centralise in an efficient, modern way. Taking steps towards this will be a difficult matter however"
ETH_Tax_Question_desc:0 "The Empire of Abyssinia has had no official tax code yet, and to westernise we must reform our tax code. And there are a few options: The people have been pushing for a land tax that will fall primarily on the rich landowners, our western advisers advise us to copy the progressive tax system of the European powers and finally the nobles are pushing for a low flat tax"
ETH_Permanent_Feudal_Borders_desc:0 "We need to establish ways to control which noble controls what in a far more stable and politically healthy fashion, and quickly, lest they will be forever at each other's throats and threatening Imperial stability"
ETH_Governorship_Question_desc:0 "It is time to decide who will govern the various provinces of the Abyssinian Empire. There are a few options: We can either allow the people to elect their governors, we can have the Negus appoint them or we can allow the nobles to govern their own land."
ETH_Ethiopia_Scout_Association_desc:0 "Our youth needs productive pursuits to spend their energy, in ways that benefit the lives of others"
ETH_Military_Question_desc:0 "Currently our army is commanded by nobles and members of the Sellasie family, and commoners are pretty much blocked from most high roles in the military even if they are sometimes more skilled than the nobles. Should we allow commoners into the army?"
ETH_Finish_The_Reforms_desc:0 "The reforms are done and Abyssinia has a future ahead of it. The question is what that future holds..."
ETH_New_Constitucion_desc:0 "A new constitution shall be written, and the decisions of earlier reforms matter much in its drafting. Its time to see which wind will steer the Empire forward!"
ETH_People_Constitucion_desc:0 "The legitimacy of a ruler emanates from his people. Halie Selassie I will be the first Emperor to grant control of vast parts of the state's apparatus to elected officials. May the voice of the small folk be heard"
ETH_Freedom_Speech_desc:0 "The people should have the right to say and think whatever they want, even if its not something we as a nation would generally agree with. Disagreement is what brings new ideas to the world"
ETH_Freedom_Religion_desc:0 "Ethiopia, in it's millenar history, has been home to many faiths, from the Jews of old Axum to the Muslims of the walled city of Harar. They all shall live in freedom, as equal citizens of the Empire"
ETH_Enrich_People:0 "Poverty is more than something that takes lives, but takes prosperity from all citizens, even those who are doing well for themselves. We must protect the most fragile of our subject, to ensure all have a future"
ETH_Elections_desc:0 "Now, Ethiopia's first free elections are to be organised. Poltical parties rally, and many are excited for whats ahead; others nervous. Who shall be the first Prime Minister to be appointed by His Majesty?"
ETH_Emperor_Constitucion_desc:0 "For too long lesser men have stood in the way of progress; in the way of Ethiopia. The Empire will be reorganised into a way that allows for the Negus to the be ultimate authority on all matters!"
ETH_Revered_Emperor_desc:0 "All people, great and small, shall keep this one great truth in mind : Halie Sellasie brought peace, freedom and justice to his reformed Empire. "
ETH_Control_Church_desc:0 "The Faithful need proper guidance; not from those would seek earthly power, but who would ensure peace is mantained through the Blessed rule of the King of Kings"
ETH_Royal_Advisors_desc:0 "The Emperor brings his closest advisers into the fold, ensuring good governance and leadership for decades to come"
ETH_Lion_Of_Judah_desc:0 "From the entourage to escorted the Queen of Sheba back home to the present day we have had as a symbol the mighty lion. The 225th king since David, the greatest of all earthly lords has a legacy so grand, it outshines even his mighty efforts for our glory"
ETH_Noble_Constitucion_desc:0 "The Noble lords and ladies of Ethiopia have held the empire together for Millenia, and shall do for more! Small matters such as budget and military issues are too trivial to bother the mighty King of Kings, his trusted vassals will look after it for him"
ETH_Noble_Investment_desc:0 " We will ensure that Ethiopia gets what it needs by whatever means necessary, whatever the costs, and whom we should deal with"
ETH_Power_Of_Tradition_desc:0 "Nobles are so because the have more than stature, or blood. They are trained form birth to be administrators and soldiers, same as the fishermen who is raised fron birth to fish. After all, why should we change what has worked for millenia?"
ETH_Noble_Armies_desc:0 "Our armies have men who trained from birth to lead them. Now that we have the proper training and equipment for our footsoldiers, victory is a matter of time against any foe!"
ETH_Power_Council_desc:0 "It is time for the council of nobles to take full control of the government from Sellasie's goons, from now on he will be ruling as a King among Kings, being a weak figurehead for the council to stand behind."
ETH_Military_Reforms_desc:0 "Our military performed rather poorly during the Weiltrkeig; we shall access why exactly and find a proper solution, so that we can reclaim our territory in the Ogaden, ours by treaty and law."
ETH_Hire_Askari_Veterans_desc:0 "Many men in Mittelafrika tire of the garrison duty, the constant patrolling for unseen foes. We shall bring them here, where their skills can be properly used"
ETH_New_Arms_Production_desc:0 "We shall increase our efforts to better equip the army; it seems that according to the Askari, our handguns are better suited to a hunter's collection to an army arsenal!"
ETH_Import_Small_Arms_desc:0 "The sad state of our handguns c-an be improved however, with some effort by reverse engineering foreign ones. Issue is we still need to buy said guns!"
ETH_Artillery_Effort_desc:0 "Artillery is a vital part of modern war, and one that we have never truly mastered. Thankfully, our foreign friends know exactly how to design and man these engines of destruction"
ETH_Buy_Tanks_desc:0 "Tanks and other mechanised vehicles may be ill suited for the highlands of Gondar. However, in the flat plain of the Ogaden... They can be the difference between victory and utter defeat"
ETH_Foreign_Doctrine_desc:0 "Our high command has reached a conclusion: Hurling wave after wave of militia at the enemy may not be the best course of action every time. Perhaps its best to ask one of our foreign officers what we should rather do? Noble officers can be quite stubborn after all..."
ETH_Improve_Firepower_desc:0 "Victory through firepower! Our enemies will be trumpled by the might and range of our guns, and we shall take steps to better make use of them"
ETH_Modernise_High_Command_desc:0 "Our planning perhaps should be more refined than 'attack the enemy with full force'. No matter how hard it will be, we will ensure proper patient men will plan and lead the charge of the Empire into war"
ETH_Legacy_Of_Adowa_desc:0 "We will never rely on foreigners to ensure victory. We cannot! For too long the people's of the world have forgotten the might of he Victors of Adwa! All of Africa shall se us for what we truly are!"
ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_desc:0 "By utilising foreign blueprints and expertise, we can ensure that we have Ethiopian guns made by Ethiopians for Ethiopians, which will the whole ordeal a lot cheaper"
ETH_Special_Equipment_desc:0 "We must ensure our brave men have everything at hand to fight the battles for our future"
ETH_Anti_Imperialist_Spirit_desc:0 "Those who would try to conquer us underestimate our spirit time and time again. From Wofla to Adwa, envious vultures attempt to break our spirit and subjugate the free peoples of Ethiopia. Never will they succeed!"
ETH_Improve_Drilling_desc:0 "We will sharpen minds, tire legs, and train aims, and through relentless drills ,we shall shape these ragged folk we call 'soldiers' into proper fighting men!"
ETH_Trust_Officers_desc:0 "We need to ensure our officers have a larger degree of autonomy in the battlefield, as they would then be able to adapt to the ever changing landscape of war"
ETH_Develop_Weapons_desc:0 "More than copying advanced techniques, we should ensure that the design itself our guns is made here, by the Empire, for the Empire!"
ETH_Proffesional_Army_desc:0 "We have indeed succeeded in turning the failures of our army into successes, and a mass of levies into proper divisions and army groups. We now can turn our gaze towards peace, for we are prepared for war."
ETH_Doctrine_I_desc:0 "Knowing what to do at sea is far more than steering a ship towards enemy waters; we need to have missions and operational hierarchy. Thankfully, our navy is quite young and thus flexible"
ETH_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "The position of our ports is incredibly strategic. No enemy lack shipping near the Gulf of Aden, we can strike unseen and deal great damage"
ETH_Submarine_Doctrine_desc:0 "We shall plan a grand blockade of the Red Sea; no convoy will pass through unless we see fit"
ETH_Destroyer_desc:0 "We shall ensure our own convoys are safe from raiding, with regular patrols from brand new anti-submarine vessels"
ETH_Cruiser_desc:0 "The navy needs more tonnage if we are to attain control of the horn. Cruisers are suited to our needs, especially if projections of Somalian naval strength are correct"
ETH_Doctrine_II_desc:0 "We now shall have in place a proper school of naval officers; as war fast approaches, they must be ready for the ever changing battlefield in the sea."
ETH_Dream_Sky_desc:0 "The sky is under our reach. But it could soon be not under our control. News have reached Adis Ababa that Somalia is planning to buy even more airplaines, and expand its airforce. The goal of this esclation obvious and will not go unanswered!"
ETH_Hire_Experts_desc:0 "To truly control the skies, we will need men who have fought in the air, and know about what that is like. Then, we can plan on how wrestle the skies of the horn under our control!"
ETH_Advanced_Doctrine_desc:0 "Planning air missions is a complicated matter; weather, distance and enemy forces all must be taken into consideration in equal measure. Not all men are nearly enough talented to know what to do in these cases, however, training is the best remedy for lack of talent"
ETH_Train_Pilots_desc:0 "Having planes is no good if our pilots are amateur couriers at best; the Imperial Airforce can become a force to be reckoned with, but only if we can give it the attention it deserves"
ETH_Skylions_desc:0 "We shall train a group of top men, among our best, to fall from the sky straight into battle. With the heart of a Lion, they shall strike where we couldn't reach, and fight were we couldn't fight"
ETH_Harer_Airbase_desc:0 "We shall greatly expand an existing aifield in Harer, in preparation to the war to come; projections are that from there we can reach even the farthest point of Somalia"
ETH_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Ensuring aerial dominance in the Horn will be a difficult task, but we believe we are up to the challenge; after our airforce is sightly upgraded, of course"
ETH_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The cities, ports; supply and battle lines of our enemies. All shall be within our grasp to reach, and to destroy!"
ETH_CAS_effort_desc:0 "Controlling the battlefield from the air is an attractive prospect; However, having aircraft and pilots capable of doing so is an expensive and time consuming endeavour"
ETH_Crush_Somalia_desc:0 "Ogaden is ours by treaty, but the weakness of previous rulers and our troubles in Eritrea prevented us from making this into a fact. Our enemy, the Mad Mullah, is dead. His legacy alive in the upstart nation of Somalia, a collection of clans and tyrants pretending to be a nation. Germany is no longer in a position to intervene; we shall strike at them as soon as possible and reclaim our lands!"
ETH_Pacify_Ogaden_desc:0 "Victory in battle is often the easy part of a conquest; many of the Ogaden locals had never seen the Ethiopian flag until our victory. They soon all will, however, because integrating the Ogaden is our highest priority"
ETH_Industrial_Modernisation_desc:0 "We have very little manufacturing in the Empire, and the economy is so small and isolated, we lack virtually any presence worldwide. We must change this!"
ETH_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "We need to make proper use of our capacity to make heavy construction materials if government projects are to be run in an efficient manner"
ETH_Coffee_desc:0 "From the oldest farms in Kaffa, comes the great rich we can now plant. The chaotic situation in Brazil means the coffee market is in a very open position, we should leap and grab our share of the demand. After all, what modern man doesn't need coffee?"
ETH_Finish_Modernisation_desc:0 "Our industrial efforts come to fruition at last; the future is now within the Empire's reach; we just have to grab it!"

### Events ###
ethiopia.1.t:0 "Ethiopia, an Empire at the Crossroads"
ethiopia.1.d:0 "Ethiopia, also known as Abyssinia, was the only African state which managed to remain independent during the XIXth century Scramble for Africa, successfully defeating an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory kick started the process of modernisation in the Ethiopian Empire, in order to bring the country close to European standards regarding its economy, army and administration. In 1918, under empress Zauditu, the Ethiopian Empire entered the Weltkrieg on the side of the Germans, successfully annexing the Italian colonies of Somaliland and Eritrea. Another sign of Ethiopia's modernisation was the expansion of the DPAEB railroad, a vital transport link for the country. In 1930, Empress Zauditu died with no surviving children, which prompted her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen to ascend the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to start a new series of reforms to bring Ethiopia 'into the west'. These initiatives, however, were fiercely opposed by the conservative nobility of the nation, who had been greatly strengthened by the annexation of the Italian colonies and the subsequent expansion of the army. Haile Selassie also faces opposition from the important Italian business community in Eritrea, who feel that any disturbance to the status quo will mean an end to their privileges. The imperial government, meanwhile, has suffered another blow in 1935, when a report by the German Ministry of Trade announced the fragile economic situation of the DKAEB, which puts the entire Ethiopian economy at risk - thus definitely proving the inefficiency of Ethiopia rallying to the German sphere. With an worldwide economic crisis approaching, Ethiopia may need to decide whether to continue its current relationship with Germany, seek new trade partners or pursue her own independent foreign policy."
ethiopia.1.a:0 "We stand strong!"
ethiopia.2.t:0 "The DAKEB and the approaching bankruptcy"
ethiopia.2.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, linking Addis Abeba to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is currently mainly used to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. Now, the general economic downturn in the world has meant that less ore is being purchased, resulting in fewer transports for the DPAEB. The situation has now reached such a level that it is nearing bankruptcy."
ethiopia.2.a:0 "Keep it running!"
ethiopia.railway.bankruptcy:0 "Bankruptcy is looming!"
ethiopia.2.b:0 "Sell the railway"
ethiopia.3.t:0 "The DKAEB is sold"
ethiopia.3.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, linking Addis Abeba, in Ethiopia, to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is currently mainly used to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. The present economic downturn in the world has meant that less ore is being purchased, resulting in fewer transports for the DPAEB. The situation has now reached such a level that Germany has decided to sell the railway."
ethiopia.3.a:0 "Buy the Ethiopian section of the railway"
ethiopia.3.b:0 "We must let German companies buy the railway"
ethiopia.4.a:0 "Buy the Mittelafrikan section of the railway"
ethiopia.4.b:0 "An European consortium ends up buying the railway"
ethiopia.5.t:0 "The DKAEB goes bankrupt!"
ethiopia.5.d:0 "Out decision to keep the Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) running was indeed a short sighted one. The DKAEB, despite our attempts to revive it, has gone bankrupt!"
ethiopia.5.a:0 "Damn!"
ethiopia.6.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn has gone bankrupt! Our main export link, running from the Congo to Djibouti, has been forced to close down. Large amounts of people now stand without a job."
ethiopia.6.a:0 "Damn..."
ethiopia.7.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn has gone bankrupt! This major transport link, running from the Congo to Djibouti through Abyssinia, has been forced to close down. Large amounts of people now stand without a job."
ethiopia.7.a:0 "We will take it off their hands!"
ethiopia.8.t:0 "Drought!"
ethiopia.8.d:0 "A great drought is sweeping through eastern Abyssinia. With the economy already weakened by the decline of the DKAEB, we are facing mass starvation as crops fail."
ethiopia.8.a:0 "Damn!"
ethiopia.8.b:0 "Use the newly nationalised railway to distribute food!"
ethiopia.9.t:0 "Budget Readjustment"
ethiopia.9.d:0 "Now that we have taxed our people enough to repay our crippling debts, it is time to readjust our budget and end this debt crisis once and for all. We can choose to have the new budget focus on one of three things: Military production, Military production or Construction. Which one shall we choose?"
ethiopia.9.a:0 "Military Production"
ethiopia.9.b:0 "Civilian Production"
ethiopia.9.c:0 "Construction"
ethiopia.10.t:0 "Reforms in Abyssinia"
ethiopia.10.d:0 "Our emperor Haile Selassie is known to have ambitions of modernisation for the country. This includes not only plans to build new factories and infrastructure and modernise our army, but also several legal and institutional reforms to improve the quality of life for our people. However, the broadening of these reforms will mean an end to many privileges of the nobility."
ethiopia.10.a:0 "Start the reforms"
ethiopia.11.t:0 "Question of Slavery"
ethiopia.11.d:0 "The institution of slavery is still widespread in Abyssinia, with almost 2 million people currently living in slavery within Abyssinia. This has brought much criticism from the west upon Abyssinia and it is obvious we must abolish this institution in order to truly westernise, however the nobility will be quite angry with this change and we may instead institute Freedom of Womb to try and appease them and delay the death of Slavery."
ethiopia.11.a:0 "Abolish Slavery!"
ethiopia.11.b:0 "We must delay the abolition, Freedom of Womb."
ethiopia.12.t:0 "Land Reform"
ethiopia.12.d:0 "Land in Ethiopia is held in completely archaic means, usually the people who own the land do so through might and riches alone, and legal ownership is quite rare. It is time to reform the means of land ownership within Abyssinia, and there are a few ways we can do that:"
ethiopia.12.a:0 "Redistribute the land to the people"
ethiopia.12.b:0 "All land shall be owned in name by the Negus"
ethiopia.12.c:0 "Formalise the current ownership under the nobility"
ethiopia.13.t:0 "Tax Reform"
ethiopia.13.d:0 "The Empire of Abyssinia has had no official tax code yet, and to westernise we must reform our tax code. And there are a few options: The people have been pushing for a land tax that will fall primarily on the rich landowners, our western advisers advise us to copy the progressive tax system of the European powers and finally the nobles are pushing for a low flat tax"
ethiopia.13.a:0 "Establish a land tax"
ethiopia.13.b:0 "Establish a progressive tax"
ethiopia.13.c:0 "Establish a flat tax"
ethiopia.14.t:0 "Governorship Reform"
ethiopia.14.d:0 "It is time to decide who will govern the various provinces of the Abyssinian Empire. There are a few options: We can either allow the people to elect their governors, we can have the Negus appoint them or we can allow the nobles to govern their own land."
ethiopia.14.a:0 "Governors should be elected by the people."
ethiopia.14.b:0 "The Negus shall appoint his governors."
ethiopia.14.c:0 "Let the Nobles govern their land."
ethiopia.15.t:0 "Military Reform"
ethiopia.15.d:0 "Currently our army is commanded by nobles and members of the Sellasie family, and commoners are pretty much blocked from most high roles in the military even if they are sometimes more skilled than the nobles. Should we allow commoners into the army?"
ethiopia.15.a:0 "Military positions shall be meritocratic"
ethiopia.15.b:0 "Keep the army as it is"
ethiopia.16.t:0 "End of the reforms"
ethiopia.16.d:0 "Sellasie's era of reforms is now over. For better or for worse our country has changed radically and modernisation has been achieved. The Lion of Judah has been added to our Empire's flag to symbolise the rebirth of the Abyssinian Empire and it now time to start looking towards constructing a new constitution for our Empire"
ethiopia.16.a:0 "God bless the Lion"
ethiopia.17.t:0 "Sellasie's Constitution"
ethiopia.17.d:0 "Sellasie has managed to gain supreme power for himself, and the new constitution shows this. It includes many articles which give powers to the Negus but also contains some reforms built towards modernising the legal framework of Abyssinia. Abyssinia is now very much it's Emperor's country"
ethiopia.17.a:0 "All hail the Lion of Judah"
ethiopia.18.t:0 "Mekawint's Constitution"
ethiopia.18.d:0 "Through blocking many reforms and instituting many of their own, the nobles have managed to gain power for themselves, and the new constitution shows this. It contains articles that give power to the noble dominated upper house and restricts democracy and the power of Sellasie. The age old traditions of Abyssinia have been protected and it is now very much the noble's country."
ethiopia.18.a:0 "The Negusa Nesat is weak"
ethiopia.19.t:0 "People's Constitution"
ethiopia.19.d:0 "Haile Sellasie has instituted reforms that have westernised and democratised the country, and the new constitution shows this. It contains articles that protect the freedoms of the people and empower the Lower House which is controlled by the people. The power of the nobles and Sellasie himself have been restricted and it is clear that Ethiopia is now a constitutional monarchy of the western style"
ethiopia.19.a:0 "The people are strong"
ethiopia.20.t:0 "Elections"
ethiopia.20.d:0 "It is time for the first elections in Ethiopian history, The main parties that are participating are: the right-wing 'Democratic League', the centre-right 'United Ethiopian Democratic Forces', the centre-left 'Coalition for Unity and Democracy' & the left-wing 'Ethiopian People's Democratic Front'"

ethiopia.20.c:0 "Coalition for Unity and Democracy"
ethiopia.20.e:0 "Ethiopian People's Democratic Front"
ethiopia.21.t:0 "Power to the council"
ethiopia.21.d:0 "It is time for the council of nobles to take full control of the government from Sellasie's goons, from now on he will be ruling as a King among Kings, being a weak figurehead for the council to stand behind."
ethiopia.21.a:0 "Praise the council"
ethiopia.22.t:0 "Eritrean Revolt!"
ethiopia.22.d:0 "The people of Eritrea have had enough of being taxed to oblivion, and with the tribal leaders and army officers unintergrated, Eritrean nationalists have managed to organise a revolt against our rule, we must mobilise to put them down!"
ethiopia.22.a:0 "Crush Them!"
ethiopia.23.t:0 "Victory over Somalia"
ethiopia.23.d:0 "We have crushed the Somalis in war and now it is time to choose: Shall we install a friendly regime in Somalia or occupy the entire country?"
