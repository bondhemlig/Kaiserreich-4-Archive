  pacificstates.2.t:0 "The Capital"

  pacificstates.2.a:0 "The Capital stays in Sacramento!"
  pacificstates.2.b:0 "Los Angeles, where else would it be?"

  pacificstates.3.b:0 "Keep its current name"

  pacificstates.7.t:0 "Seizing US Assets"
  pacificstates.7.d:0 "War has been declared between the PSA and the US and local authorities have seized assets that belonged to the United States."
  pacificstates.7.a:0 "These are ours now"  
  pacificstates.8.t:0 "A new flag for the new pacific states ?"
  pacificstates.8.d:0 "With our troops victorious over the armies of USA, our colours fly over the Rocky Mountains from the Bitteroot Range till the very Llano Estacado. Yet the people of our four new states are concerned whether PSA will truly incorporate them. A group of new states' representatives in our congress asked their states to be represented on the new PSA flag."
  pacificstates.8.a:0 "Yes, it should represent our 'newcomers'"
  pacificstates.8.b:0 "No, we shall fly the banner that has brought us victory!"

  pacificstates.11.d:0 "The newly independent state was to have its first election. Three parties were represented in the election.
