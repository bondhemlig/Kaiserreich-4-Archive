In the November of 1919, a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. ‘The Party of Order’ was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in the following months the ‘Establishment’ was forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war. \n\nFor the past 15 years, the self-styled ‘Commune of France’ has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936, the consensus that was resolved to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is deemed as outdated by many critics, and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in her security and in her mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is varied, and it is unclear precisely which strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

He has suggested in private conversations with several important officials that the nearly defunct Muslim Committee of the International could be turned into a powerful propaganda tool aimed at Muslims in the whole world.

The Syndicalist powers have sent significant amounts of weapons and material to support the left-wing partisans in Turkey, Syria and Iraq. They have also opened a few training camps. To counteract this activity, we could declare Jihad against International. This appeal won't solve our problems, but it could be used in propaganda towards the Arabs populace of the Ottoman state.

 comfrance.134.d:0 "Now the leading Travailleur figure, Léon Blum has begun to call openly for the disparate political factions of France to unite in opposition to the Jacobin government which many view as having corrupted and betrayed the Revolution. This Popular Front, despite being resisted by the many state mechanisms of the Jacobins, has already conducted several major industrial actions and political rallies in the larger cities. Fearful that this open challenge to the party's rule might lead to a direct contest for the leadership of the Commune, the Renseignements Généraux is recommending that the Conseil des Commissaires arrest Blum and the other leaders linked to the Front - most prominently other than Blum himself, the still respected general Maurice Gamelin."

 comfrance.135.d:0 "The various leading figures of the Front Populaire, as well as other prominent potential allies of theirs, such as Maurice Gamelin have been arrested and are being tried for treason. The Paris Trial aimed to prove that Blum and his associates had undermined the Revolution and 'weakened France's defences against the German foe'. Blum, being both a lawyer and excellent public speaker, used the courtroom to make a brilliant indictment of the Jacobin regime. Gamelin remained silent throughout; refusing to recognise the courts right to try him. The trial has not gone according to plan and the defendants have, despite heavy manipulation of the proceedings, proven largely successful in rebutting the charges, and won sympathetic coverage in both the unofficial domestic and international press. It has become such an embarrassment to our Communist regime that some of the leadership is considering ordering it called off. Others wish to push forward and execute the defendants regardless, as they have become far too great a threat to be allowed to go free."

Communes throughout France have taken this opportunity to liquidate their own branches of the Communist Party. Gamelin and Blum have restored the formerly abolished Syndicalist institutions the CGT and BGT and in emergency elections, Gamelin has been elected as Chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail and Blum appointed as Chairman of the Comité de Salut Public."

 comfrance.141.d:0 "The extremist Jacobin faction has driven the illegitimate Commune to the precipice. The socialists fight among themselves as France burns. The traitor general Maurice Gamelin failed to overthrow the Communist at the first attempt and was forced to retreat south. We have received word via secret channels that Gamelin is willing to recognise our Republic in return for aid in defeating the Jacobins. Although considered one of the worst traitors France has ever seen for leading the reds in the first civil war which saw us reduced to our exile in Algiers, this could be our best chance to return home and drive out the craven Communards that stole it from us."

His soldiers are advancing on Marseille, surely to prepare the way for the Nationalist forces that are even now readying to invade our homeland. Although this shows that he has abandoned his erstwhile allies in the Front Populaire, the syndicalists have taken this opportunity to redouble their efforts, launching uprisings across France."
