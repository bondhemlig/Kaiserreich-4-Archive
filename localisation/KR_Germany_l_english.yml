### Focustree ###
GER_doctrine_new:0 "Military Reform"
GER_doctrine_new_desc:0 "After the death of Hans von Seeckt and the retirement of August von Mackensen, the Chief of General Staff has been involved in constant debate over which methods the German Army should use as a tactical basis, or doctrine. "
GER_doctrine_great_war:0 "Trench Weaponry"
GER_doctrine_great_war_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg was won in the trenches. The core part of any army for the last two hundred years has been artillery and infantry, and so it shall remain!"
GER_doctrine_great_war_2:0 "Weltkrieg School" 
GER_doctrine_great_war_2_desc:0 "By expanding on lessons learned during the Weltkrieg we can improve our military strategy."
GER_doctrine_mobile:0 "Motorised Divisions"
GER_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "While a machine-gun nest and a trench is almost impassable to infantry, panzers have shown that modern war need not be stale and immobile. While we should lean back on a large infantry army, armored fists should be utilised to tear enemy lines apart."
GER_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "Mobility School"
GER_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "Swift manoeuvres, encircling and cutting off pockets of resistance is the way of the future. Motorised infantry can reach tactically important locations in days where traditional infantry would need weeks. The trenches of the Weltkrieg are a thing of the past. For good."
GER_doctrine_mobile_3:0 "Raise new Panzer Divisions"
GER_doctrine_mobile_3_desc:0 "With the doctrines laid out for us, several new panzer divisions should be raised. \n [This will, over time, feed you armoured divisions through events.]"
GER_mil_expansion_naval_1:0 "Expand the Naval Industry"
GER_mil_expansion_naval_1_desc:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands unchallenged in any sea on the planet. For now. The Union of Britain, The French, The Americans and the Japanese will all jealously try to outdo us. If left unchecked, our naval domination will end. We should continue the large navy modernisation project initiated back in 1934."
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing:0 "Heed the words of Dönitz"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing_desc:0 "The highly respected and talented Karl Dönitz reminds us that the success of ocean-going navies is centred around the success of their Battleships. Our fleets should strive for large, decisive battles and destroy our opposition before they get a chance to intercept and harass our important and valuable shipping routes."
GER_doctrine_base_strike:0 "Listen to Patzig and Raeder"
GER_doctrine_base_strike_desc:0 "Patzig and Raeder have, in close communication with Sperrle of the Luftwaffe, devised a type of naval strategy reliant on mobile air-bases through Aircraft carriers. These men are convinced that on the open sea, where air cover cannot be provided from inland bases, the Aircraft carrier will dominate naval warfare for years to come."
GER_naval_plans:0 "Deutschland rule the waves"
GER_naval_plans_desc:0 "With our naval strategy laid out before us, the final necessary steps are at hand. Several of our ship constructions have been lying in hiatus during our staggering economy and political unrest. Now however is the time to resume and finish them. \n [This will, over time, feed you ships through events.]"
GER_doctrine_last:0 "Restructure the Chains of Command"
GER_doctrine_last_desc:0 "While centralisation has its benefits, modern war requires decentralised command, allowing lower ranking officers more personal initiative to improvise in response to the current situation. This idea, called Auftragstaktik, must be the bread and butter of the modern German army."
GER_security:0 "Status of the FAUD"
GER_security_desc:0 "The FAUD have for a long time been a thorn in the side of German Society, promoting syndicalist ideals to the common man. The Kaiser feels worried that they may cause great unrest if left unchecked... But the politicians of the Reichstag warn that banning the party could turn them even more radical... and violent. Whatever path we go, we must tread it carefully."
GER_kaiserbund_proposial:0 "Kaiserbund Proposal"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_desc:0 "The liberal party of the Reichstag, but also some individuals from the right and the left have for some time been discussing setting up a Kaiserbund, a German variant of the British commonwealth. The colonies have become expensive to maintain and centralised government of them have turned out to be inefficient. Perhaps reform is the only way?"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_agreed:0 "Kaiserbund Project"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_agreed_desc:0 "With the project initiated work has been hectic in the Reichstag. While speaking of decentralisation is one thing, implementing it is another. Local armies, local governance and relationships with the indigenous, local populace needs to be established."
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_marocco:0 "Morocco Kaiserbund"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_marocco_desc:0 "Morroco has offered our nation little other than strategically located ports and violent uprisings. In the memory of Abd el-Krim and his Berber revolts, we should let Johannes Bell deal with the Riffian people. Who better to keep order than a lawyer?"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_sierra_leone:0 "Sierra Leon Kaiserbund"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_sierra_leone_desc:0 "The state of Sierra Leone is quite small and offers us little more than an important port on the Western reaches of Africa. Mainly made up of jungle, one can imagine an adventurer such as Hermann Detzner governing it excellently!"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_madagascar:0 "Madagaskar Kaiserbund"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_madagascar_desc:0 "Madagascar has been claimed to be rich in natural resources, but due to inefficient governance little has come of it. Few men know Africa as well as Arnold Schultze however, and if anyone can govern it to a stellar member of the Kaiserbund, it is he!"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_lanca_mala_sarawak:0 "Indian Ocean Kaiserbund"
GER_kaiserbund_proposial_lanca_mala_sarawak_desc:0 "There are many heroes of the Weltkrieg, but question is if any of them has reached as vast popularity as Hellmuth von Mücke after his courageous raids with the SMS Emden. He knows the Pacific on the back of his hand, although it might be beneficial to cooperate with the local rulers and divide the area into several states."
GER_kaiserbund_cambodia_laos_vietnam:0 "Kaiserbund Indochina"
GER_kaiserbund_cambodia_laos_vietnam_desc:0 "The wealthy and very populous regions of Indochina has a history of resisting foreign occupiers. Erich Schultz-Ewerth might be man enough to keep it under control, but perhaps it would be wiser to split the region up in several, smaller states?"
GER_kaiserbund_last:0 "End of the Kaiserbund Project"
GER_kaiserbund_last_desc:0 "With the majority of our colonies now well integrated into the Kaiserbund we need to look at our largest colony, Mittelafrika. It has been incredibly taxing to maintain a centralised government there, but there's also Malta, Yemen and not to mention China, which is very hard indeed to govern from Berlin."
GER_security_2:0 "Ban French Organisations?"
GER_security_2_desc:0 "The formerly French-controlled regions in the Western parts of Germany have been unruly for a long time. French nationalism is widespread in the population, and French cultural and political organisations exist a plenty. Banning them could suppress French nationalism. Or it could radicalise it. The French will not be happy either way. "
GER_security_3:0 "Manoeuvres in Elsass-Lothringen"
GER_security_3_desc:0 "The despicable Parisians feel bold enough to defy our rule and are supporting insurgents in Lorraine! After extensive talks with the Kaiser and High Command, the Chancellor has approved partial mobilisation of the reserves and is considering massive military exercise in Alsace-Lorraine, including air and armour detachments and military observers from Mitteleuropa member states."
GER_security_4:0 "Put the Syndicalists Back in Their Place"
GER_security_4_desc:0 "The greatest threat to peace and stability in the world is by far the Syndicalists, and they have no greater stronghold than in France. For years, our high command has dreamed of leading troops into Paris again, restoring decency and order in Europe. We should be certain we are prepared, the French will fight more ferociously now than they did in the Weltkrieg, for sure..."
GER_foreign_aid:0 "Aid Our Allies"
GER_foreign_aid_desc:0 "If we want to preserve our Hegemony we must ensure our allies and protectorates throughout the world are strong and loyal. Let us invest in our puppets and colonies."
GER_IRE_deal:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
GER_IRE_deal_desc:0 "The Irish have turned to Germany for protection. We should offer them an aid treaty so that we'll have a loyal ally in the fight against the Union of Britain."
GER_DKB_deal:0 "Military Mission to the Cossacks"
GER_DKB_deal_desc:0 "If we are to keep the Russians in check we must ensure we can combat them on all fronts. Let us send aid to our allies in the Don-Kuban union and help them build their army."
GER_Mauser_werke:0 "Contracts with Mauser"
GER_Mauser_werke_desc:0 "By sponsoring the Mauser corporation we can increase and improve our small arms production."
GER_mil_expansion_air_1:0 "Construct New Airstrips"
GER_mil_expansion_air_1_desc:0 "By constructing new airports in Wallonia we can get a greater reach over French airspace in case of a war."
GER_mil_expansion:0 "Military Expansion"
GER_mil_expansion_desc:0 "We have won our place in the sun, but if we want to keep it, we must make sure our army is second to none. Let us invest in military research and expansion."
GER_Luftwaffe_fighter:0 "Fighter Focus"
GER_Luftwaffe_fighter_desc:0 "By focusing on fighter research the Luftwaffe will repel all and any enemy incursion into German airspace!"
GER_Luftwaffe_bomber:0 "Bomber Focus"
GER_Luftwaffe_bomber_desc:0 "By focusing on Bombers the Luftwaffe will deliver deadly strikes on enemy industry and supply lines."
GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1:0 "Build More Airbases"
GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1_desc:0 "Build airbases both in the Heimat and outer provinces so that we can set the infrastructure for better defence and offence in the skies."
GER_Henschel_Albatros:0 "Contracts with Albatros"
GER_Henschel_Albatros_desc:0 "Let us commission the Albatros-Flugzeugwerke GmbH to design naval bombers and carrier aircraft for us."
GER_Junkers_Fogger:0 "Contracts with Junkers Fogger"
GER_Junkers_Fogger_desc:0 "Junkers Fogger is a leading developer of modern combat aircraft, in particular of the close air support."
GER_air_doc:0 "Lessons of the Weltkrieg"
GER_air_doc_desc:0 "The tactics of some twenty years ago, have become severely outdated, in particular in the use of bomber aircraft and how to protect them.  "
GER_air_doc_2:0 "Modern Air Doctrines"
GER_air_doc_2_desc:0 "By relying on the youngest and brightest minds of the Luftwaffe we can make sure that our air force does not only have the weight of industry behind it, but also the finesse of modern tactics."
GER_mil_expansion_land_1:0 "Militarist Revival"
GER_mil_expansion_land_1_desc:0 "After our victory in the Weltkrieg, the German people grew tired of war and conquest and are feeling content with our power. It is time for us to revive the militaristic spirit of the German people, in the name of the Reich and the Kaiser!"
GER_Infantry_divs:0 "New Weapons"
GER_Infantry_divs_desc:0 "While the German army has the greatest soldiers in the world, it must not lag behind in equipment. Even the greatest of soldier will have a hard time defeating a better equipped enemy."
GER_political_1:0 "Imperial Restructuring"
GER_political_1_desc:0 "While it is undeniable the German empire is the greatest nation to ever grace the pages of history, there is always room for improvement. In light of recent 'shortcomings' of our policies we should look into various changes and reforms we can make for a better future."
GER_black_monday:0 "Aftermath of the Black Monday"
GER_black_monday_desc:0 "The great crash of 1936, widely known as the 'Black Monday' has had a massive impact on German politics, culture, and society. While the damage might never be fixed, we should enact reforms and recovery policies to regain some of our lost capacity."
GER_mil_industry_1:0 "The Wilhelm Groener Plan - Initiation"
GER_mil_industry_1_desc:0 "There are few men in the German Empire who understands military matters and logistics as well as Wilhelm Groener. The highly decorated former general has suggested a plan for relativizing the economy by invested in our military industry. He claims that to get the economy running, people need to get work. What better place than in the military industrial complex, governed by the state?" 
GER_mil_industry_2:0 "The Wilhelm Groener Plan - Progression"
GER_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "While we have some part of the way, Groener claims that more can, and must be, done. By expanding the military industry further, we can slowly, but surely, defeat the effects of The Black Monday. At the same time, we'll also strengthen our military even further, assuring that our nation will not be overrun by the French anytime soon." 
GER_mil_industry_3:0 "The Wilhelm Groener Plan - Completion"
GER_mil_industry_3_desc:0 "The final steps of the Groener plan needs to be undertaken. Once completed, we have revitalised our arms industry to its fullest. Soon enough Germany will be standing with a straight back once more, as not only the dominant power of Europe, but the world! Deutschland über alles!" 
GER_civ_industry_1:0 "The Schacht Plan - Initiation"
GER_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "Hjalmar Schacht is a prominent figure in the finance departments of the Kaiserreich. With many years of experience in the banking industry there are few men who understands economic recessions and how to treat them better than Schacht. He warns that the reconstruction will take time, but that the end result will be most rewarding. Only time will tell..."
GER_civ_industry_2:0 "The Schacht Plan - Progression"
GER_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "As civilian industry continues to expand under Schacht, we are slowly building up towards total recovery. There's without a doubt still some way to go, but Hjalmar assures us that we are getting closer to restoring our economy every day. "
GER_civ_industry_3:0 "The Schacht Plan - Completion"
GER_civ_industry_3_desc:0 "With our civilian industry once again strong, but not yet booming, we are required to take just a few more steps. Soon enough German industry will tower above the rest of the world once more, as the steady influx of resources from the colonies assures a massive production boost."
GER_industry_finished:0 "Full Recovery"
GER_industry_finished_desc:0 "After years of economic failure and crisis, the German industry have finally recovered! We can once again finally compete with the rest of the world! \n Thank God for Schacht and Groener!"
GER_homeland:0 "Heimat Focus"
GER_homeland_desc:0 "If we are to ensure the security and prosperity of our home provinces we must reconfigure our internal policies. We should also consider funding various science projects that could benefit our efforts."
GER_research_expansion:0 "Extra Research Funding"
GER_research_expansion_desc:0 "Let us invest in science and technology to stimulate advances in both military and civilian affairs."
GER_ig_farben:0 "Invest In IG Farben"
GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "We can invest in IG Farben, a pharmaceuticals company currently researching ways to synthesise various chemical compounds that might prove useful to our interests."
GER_krupp:0 "Krupp Projects"
GER_krupp_desc: "The Krupp dynasty is an almost 400-year-old Dynasty of Industrious Germans, who has fed the German war machine ever since the Thirty Years' War! It is time we put them in state employment again, as their talents will be badly needed with a new Weltkrieg on the horizon."
GER_hahn_meitner:0 "Hahn & Meitner"
GER_hahn_meitner_desc:0 "Herr Hahn and Fräulein Meitner are both extremely talented physicists, Hahn discovered nuclear isomerism and Meitner is a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute! Together we believe the two can help create extremely powerful tools for society. And even more powerful weapons."
GER_zuse:0 "Konrad Zuse"
GER_zuse_desc:0 "Konrad Zuse has already handed in several patents for what he calls a 'computing devices'. With proper sponsorship, his mind could be put to good use by the state, for the state."
GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society:0 "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society_desc:0 "Recent investments in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science have resulted in greater research capacity in various fields"


### Event text ###
 gerdom.1.t:0 "The Constitution of the German Reich"
 gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, the Constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the North German Federation and of four Southern German states. This constitution put the Southern German states under the influence of the North German Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich. \n\nAccording to the constitution, the empire was a federation of 25 German states. The Bundespräsidium was held by the King of Prussia, who had the title of German Emperor. The Emperor appointed the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws were enacted by the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years. \n\nHowever, it is the Emperor, not the Bundesrat or the Reichstag, who leads the power in the German Empire. With an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor."
 gerdom.1.a:0 "A constitution guarantees stability, at least."
 
 gerdom.2.t:0 "Hans von Seeckt dies"
 gerdom.2.d:0 "Our Chief of General Staff, Hans von Seeckt, has died today in Berlin. The hero of the Intervention in China passed away peacefully in his sleep. Our nation is mourning the loss of a true German hero."
 gerdom.2.a:0 "A state funeral is least we can do!"
 
 gerdom.3.t:0 "A State Funeral for a war hero"
 gerdom.3.d:0 "A state funeral has been given for Hans von Seeckt. All-important dignitaries were in attendance. Afterward, the Chief of the Army, August von Mackensen, could be seen whispering something to the Kaiser."
 gerdom.3.a:0 "I wonder what von Mackensen is up to?"
 
 gerdom.4.t:0 "August von Mackensen retires"
 gerdom.4.d:0 "August von Mackensen has delivered his official retirement message to the Kaiser, wearing his trademark Life Hussar uniform. The Field Marshal is already eighty-six years old, and wishes merely to live out his days in peace. The Kaiser accepted the resignation, and ordered a celebration in his honour."
 gerdom.4.a:0 "This might be the time to reform our military."
 
 gerdom.5.t:0 "Reorganisation of the Army"
 gerdom.5.d:0 "With new doctrines calling for a mobile tank force, Germany has begun to form dedicated tank divisions to break through enemy lines. The Army is looking with favour on the new equipment."
 gerdom.5.a:0 "Create the Panzer Divisions!"
 
 gerdom.6.t:0 "The Backlash within the Army"
 gerdom.6.d:0 "The Kaiser's controversial decision has caused waves within the General Staff and War Ministry. There is great displeasure within the powerful High Command of the Army for the decision and many threaten resignation!"
 gerdom.6.a:0 "It is of natural consequence..."
 
 gerdom.7.t:0 "The Status of Ceylon"
 gerdom.7.d:0 "With our economy having declined greatly after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. Another part of our colonial empire that has been put under harsh scrutiny from various commissions is Ceylon. They are complaining that upkeep is too high since this island is of only little use to the German Empire. To help with our deficit it has been proposed that we grant natives autonomy or sell island to Princely Federation. What shall we do?"
 gerdom.7.a:0 "Keep Ceylon under our control"
 gerdom.7.b:0 "Grant natives autonomous status within German Empire"
 gerdom.7.c:0 "Offer Ceylon to the Princely Federation"
 
 gerdom.8.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
 gerdom.8.d:0 "The Germans have come to us offering us the sale of Ceylon. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in Indian Ocean. What shall our reply be?"
 gerdom.8.a:0 "Welcome home, Ceylon!"
 gerdom.8.b:0 "We do not need that rock"
 
 gerdom.9.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
 gerdom.9.d:0 "Ambassador of the Princely Federation has sent a message to us declaring that government has agreed to buy Ceylon. We have begun to transfer control over island to them."
 gerdom.9.a:0 "Great"
 
 gerdom.10.t:0 "The Princely Federation refused our offer"
 gerdom.10.d:0 "The Princely Federation has replied to our offer flatly stating that they do not want Ceylon. We can now only keep things as they are or allow natives more autonomy. What shall we do?" 
 
 gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
 gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the agricultural sector of German economy is one of the most vulnerable to turmoil. With this in mind, several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and subsidies to their production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this important sector of the Reich's economy. Such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, however, as they are greatly dependant in trade with Germany. The wheat crops in the Ukraine are particularly vulnerable."
 gerdom.11.a:0 "We must protect our own peasants."
 gerdom.11.b:0 "We must uphold our foreign obligations."
 
 gerdom.12.t:0 "The increasing activity of the suffragist movement"
 gerdom.12.d:0 "Lately there has been a rise in activity of the supporters of women's suffrage, that is those who want to grant women the right to vote and to run for office. In this troubled times for the German Empire, it is not easy to choose the best solution. Granting them what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, especially the members of the Reichstag (currently elected by universal male suffrage). On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to riots and more protests, especially in the more liberal states (that already permitted female voting in regional assemblies). The third possibility is a compromise: granting women the right to vote and be elected in the local assemblies of all the constituent members of the Empire. But this last solution might only postpone the problem for the present time and we might have to deal with these suffragists again in the near future."
 gerdom.12.a:0 "Grant universal voting rights for all women!"
 gerdom.12.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies!"
 gerdom.12.c:0 "Refuse such preposterous demands!"
 
 gerdom.13.t:0 "German women demand recognition for their war effort"
 gerdom.13.d:0 "In the great war against the French syndicalist, German women have proven their loyalty and support for the Empire. Some of them proved fundamental for our propaganda efforts and many of them started working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence. For these reason, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again the government to grant women the right to vote and to run for office."
 gerdom.13.a:0 "Grant universal voting rights for all women!"
 gerdom.13.b:0 "They shall have voting rights in all local assemblies!"
 gerdom.13.c:0 "What is this syndicalist nonsense? Arrest them all!"

 gerdom.14.t:0 "Halbstarke terrorise the cities"
 gerdom.14.d:0 "With the devastating economic situation, many families struggle to earn their daily bread and the social security net is strained beyond the breaking point. Now in the last weeks, the streets of many German cities have been increasingly terrorised by gangs of teenagers. These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism, to escape boredom and frustration. More and more citizens do not feel safe anymore on the streets."
 gerdom.14.a:0 "Mein Gott! Shocking!"
 
 gerdom.15.t:0 "Organise the Youth"
 gerdom.15.d:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness displayed by parts of our nation's youth is to organise them into youth organisations, so that they can learn new skills and use their energies for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."
 gerdom.15.a:0 "This won't be necessary"
 gerdom.15.b:0 "Provide the funding"

 gerdom.16.t:0 "Commission the SMS Tirpitz"
 gerdom.16.d:0 "A new warship is now available to join our High Seas Fleet. This vessel will do much to improve our security and allow us to better project our influence and good will across the globe."
 gerdom.16.a:0 "Excellent"
 gerdom.17.t:0 "Commission the SMS Bismarck"

 gerdom.102.t:0 "Von Hammerstein-Equord Affair"
 gerdom.102.d:0 "A month before the elections, yet another scandal was revealed by the media. Die Gartenlaube, one of the newspapers owned by the DVLP chairman Alfred Hugenberg, reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with syndicalist intelligence. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the state secretary on war was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While general von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughter’s doings, the real question for von Schleicher was - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - by whom?"

 gerdom.103.t:0 "Reichskanzler Papen and the radio"
 gerdom.103.d:0 "Economic crisis has shaken the belief held by millions of Germans in their great country, and as an effect both social-democratic and radical movements started gaining on popularity. Reichskanzler von Papen hoped to turn the tide by announcing weekly radio addresses in which he would announce what steps has the government taken to combat the crisis. Despite critics saying that since the beginning of these auditions chancellor prefers to spend time in broadcasting company's headquarters rather than in Reichstag, the broadcast proved to be a great success."
 gerdom.103.a:0 "Turn up the radio!"

 gerdom.104.t:0 "Question of French speaking minorities in the German Empire"
 gerdom.104.d:0 "The French-speaking minority in our western border regions was always considered as liability, since their loyalty to our state was always in question. This is considered true especially now, with the increasingly belligerent Commune of France rising from her ashes on our western borders. Reactionist, nationalist and militarist groups want to enforce a bill that increases military and police control in Wallonia and Lorraine to effectively enforce public order, while liberals think that such drastic steps are not necessary to maintain security of our border regions."
 gerdom.104.a:0 "Increase military control in the border regions!"
 gerdom.104.b:0 "Allow these petty Frenchmen to meet in their petty clubs"
 
 gerdom.105.t:0 "Germany Suppresses its French Population!"
 gerdom.105.d:0 "The German Empire, afraid of the rising power of our state decided to tighten control in border region, since they are fearful of our growing influence! We must be patient, soon the time will come, when our brothers in Wallonia, Lorraine and Alsace shall be liberated!"
 gerdom.105.a:0 "Soon, our time shall come!"

 gerdom.106.t:0 "Further increasing our internal security"
 gerdom.106.d:0 "Despite gradual increase of military and police presence in our border region, it is still not enough. Underground French syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning minds of our French minority with syndicalist propaganda using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, part of right wing political circles demand complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation among international community..."
 gerdom.106.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient!"
 gerdom.106.b:0 "It's the time to ban all French organisations in Germany!"
 gerdom.106.c:0 "This plan was madness from the beginning, abandon it..."

 gerdom.200.d:0 "For some time now, Syndicalists sympathisers from the Rhineland have been going abroad to help their 'comrades' in their various conflicts around the world. Today, the famous underground writer Bertolt Brecht has announced his intent to join these 'International Divisions'. \n\n We could let him go, which would most likely inspire quite another few Syndicalists to go abroad after him, or we could confiscate his passport and prohibit him from leaving the country. It would maybe weaken the Syndicalist cause, but also cause tremendous outrage..."

 gerdom.206.d:0 "Now that their war has been lost, the 'International Divisions' formed from our volunteers are trying to return to their homes. Many still have their arms and all survivors are battle-hardened, indoctrinated Syndicalists. However, if we prohibit them from entering over our borders, we should be able to keep them away without to big of a scandal. But we might risk them turning against us if we ever come to to blows with the Internationale..."

 gerdom.207.d:0 "After assumptions had already been made for weeks, we now have the official confirmation: Our German Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has died in some rotten cellar, most likely in the hands of a policeman. After serving in as Syndicalist volunteer, Brecht was captured some time after the end of the war. \n\n His family, together with other Syndicalist elements, staged large-scale demonstrations centred around Berlin in his support, blaming our policy of not letting the veterans return home for his death."
 gerdom.207.a:0 "It seems we created a martyr."
 
 gerdom.208.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht has returned home"
 gerdom.208.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems like the Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has somehow managed to smuggle himself over the border. He and his family have gone underground and are openly practicing the battle against the Capitalist system..."

 gerdom.209.t:0 "The International Divisions offer their service"
 gerdom.209.d:0 "After valiantly fighting for the Syndicalist cause, the comrades and veterans of the International Divisions have cowardly been denied asylum back into their home country. After some time of drifting, many of the former members have now decided to take up arms for the liberation of their homeland from the Monarchists! While their numbers have been reduced by fighting and poverty, they are battle-hardened veterans and would make a worthy addition to the army of the Internationale."
