### Focuses ###
GER_doctrine_new:0 "Military Reform"
GER_doctrine_new_desc:0 "After the death of Hans von Seeckt and the retirement of August von Mackensen, the Chief of General Staff has been involved in constant debate over which methods the German Army should use as a tactical basis, or doctrine."
GER_doctrine_great_war:0 "Squad Tactics"
GER_doctrine_great_war_desc:0 "One thing that our intervention in the chaotic Chinese civil war has taught us is that infantryman cooperation on a face-to-face level can not be valued highly enough. But now that these so called Gruppentaktiken are taught to our soldiers, they lament inappropriate equipment..."
GER_doctrine_great_war_2:0 "The modern Art of War"
GER_doctrine_great_war_2_desc:0 "There is one book that every man who wants to become an officer in the army of the Reich must read - Clausewitz' 'The Art of War'. If we put our best military theorists on the subject, they can adapt the still applicable principles from the centuries-old book to the requirements of modern warfare."
GER_doctrine_mobile:0 "Motorised Infiltration"
GER_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "While our military high command is divided on many subjects, they are united on one topic: They say that the possibilities that mass motorisation offers to infantry in warfare can to be exploited to win fast and decisive victories on an operational scale, hearkening back to the victory of 1870/71."
GER_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "A new Doctrine"
GER_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "Some of the more radical innovators - Heinz von Guderian and Erich von Manstein, with others - in our military high command are lobbying for research into a totally new doctrine. They want to focus on the fast movement of armoured spearheads to break up solid fronts."
GER_doctrine_mobile_2_prerequisite:0 "Either §YHeinz Guderian§! or §YErich von Manstein§! is the chief of staff."
GER_doctrine_mobile_3:0 "Invest in Panzer Factories"
GER_doctrine_mobile_3_desc:0 "With a little directed investment, we could raise productivity of our armour factories by quite a lot. Some of our more conservative-minded generals will not approve of this investment, though."

GER_mil_expansion_naval_1:0 "Finish 1934 Navy Plan"
GER_mil_expansion_naval_1_desc:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands unchallenged in any sea on the planet. For now. The Union of Britain, The French, The Americans and the Japanese will all jealously try to outdo us. If left unchecked, our naval domination will end. We should continue the large navy modernisation project initiated back in 1934."
GER_global1:0 "Supply lines to Singapur"
GER_global1_desc:0 "Having a Empire across the globe has the small disadvantage of having to actually exert control over those areas, and that means sending not only soldiers, but also tax collectors and other vermin - and they need tax collection forms, and those need to be sent all the way from Germany. Better prepare for that."
GER_global2:0 "Expand Singapur Harbour"
GER_global2_desc:0 "Now that we have the capabilities to send tax collection forms, we need a harbour with the capabilities required. The harbour of Singapur is the busiest in the eastern hemisphere, with German ships on their way to the AOG, Australasians Delhi-bound and the occasional American or Russian. Commerce is good; We should expand the harbour."
GER_global3:0 "Treaty with Hawaii"
GER_global3_desc:0 "Singapur is currently our easternmost port, and the pacific is vast. Should we ever come into a position where we want to strike against the western coasts of America, we need a closer base. And one is especially promising; The independent islands of Hawai'i. We should approach their government to ask for basing rights."
GER_global4:0 "Strike at the Panamá Canal"
GER_global4_desc:0 "The Panamá Canal is a critical avenue of both world shipping and the projection of World Power. We must secure it for our own Imperial purposes."
GER_north_sea1:0 "Expand Wilhelmshaven"
GER_north_sea1_desc:0 "We require an expanded port for basing for both our Submarines and our Larger Fleets. Expanding Wilhelmshaven is a good start to accomplish this."
GER_north_sea2:0 "Bases in Flanders-Wallonia"
GER_north_sea2_desc:0 "We require further ports into the North Sea and the English Channel, expanding our Naval Bases within Flanders-Wallonia will help this goal."
GER_north_sea3:0 "Lease Trondheim from Norway"
GER_north_sea3_desc:0 "A proposal has been made to lease the port of Trondheim from the Norwegians in return for monetary compensation and our protection. We should seek to make this offer."
GER_north_sea4:0 "Secure the Skagerrak"
GER_north_sea4_desc:0 "The Skagerrak is the vital strait between Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We must secure it to prevent our fleets becoming locked within the Baltic."
GER_generic_navy1:0 "Fortify the North Sea Coast"
GER_generic_navy1_desc:0 "The North Sea Coast must be defended. If our fleet is lost then our flanks are dangerously exposed, we must begin fortifying the coastline at once."
GER_generic_navy2:0 "Fortify our naval bases"
GER_generic_navy2_desc:0 "In line with the Coastline fortifications we should seek to better defend our vital Naval Bases from Amphibious invasion."
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing:0 "Heed the words of Dönitz"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing_desc:0 "The highly respected and talented Karl Dönitz reminds us that the success of ocean-going navies is dependent on them actively controlling the seas. Our fleets should strive for large, decisive battles and destroy our opposition before they get a chance to intercept our supply routes. This doctrine has been dubbed Präsenzflotte."
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing2:0 "U-Boat Warfare"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing2_desc:0 "We conducted U-Boat warfare throughout WW1 but we restricted our attacks. This shall continue but with a new range of U-Boat models."
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing3:0 "Larger, Faster, Heavier"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing3_desc:0 "Larger, Faster, Heavier are words our Navy should live by when designing new Warships. We shall make it so."
GER_doctrine_base_strike:0 "Listen to Patzig and Raeder"
GER_doctrine_base_strike_desc:0 "Patzig and Raeder have, in close communication with Sperrle of the Luftwaffe, devised a type of naval strategy reliant on mobile air-bases through Aircraft carriers. These men are convinced that on the open sea, where there help can take days to arrive, ships can only be risked if they fight together as one group, called Operative Manövergruppen."
GER_doctrine_base_strike2:0 "Naval Air Force Research"
GER_doctrine_base_strike2_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe demand extra funding if they are to support the Manövergruppen tactic. We shall grant this funding with the expectation of solid results."
GER_doctrine_base_strike3:0 "Extend Carrier Research"
GER_doctrine_base_strike3_desc:0 "Manövergruppen requires new Carriers, we shall construct these stalwart new additions to our Grand Fleet at once."
GER_doctrine_fleet1:0 "Modernise our Cruisers"
GER_doctrine_fleet1_desc:0 "Crusiers both Light and Heavy make-up the backbone of our Navies. We must modernise our Cruisers at once to stay competitive."
GER_doctrine_fleet2:0 "New Destroyer fleet"
GER_doctrine_fleet2_desc:0 "Destroyers cannot escape our Modernisation program, we will draft and construct a new modern destroyer fleet."
GER_tirpitzprogramm:0 "The Tirpitzprogramm"
GER_tirpitzprogramm_desc:0 "By 1914, the Tirpitzprogramm had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world. That was a long time ago, and the British fleet is no longer the biggest in the world, but we must not be idle, we must continue our ship building effort if we are to remain master of the high seas."
GER_naval_plans:0 "Deutschland beherrscht die Meere"
GER_naval_plans_desc:0 "Deutschland beherrscht die Meere are the words our Navy lives and ies by. We shall launch a new series of training exercises on the North Sea coast to give our Sailors some more experience at sea."
GER_marines1:0 "Independent Seebatallions"
GER_marines1_desc:0 "We must retrain and expand our Marine corps, granting them more autonomy within the Naval Command should also grant us better results."
GER_marines2:0 "Transports for our Marines"
GER_marines2_desc:0 "We lack dedicated Landing Craft for our Seebattalions, this must change if we are to storm the British coastline or even further shores. We shall design and construct a new dedicated amphibious landing craft."
GER_doctrine_last:0 "New Textbooks"
GER_doctrine_last_desc:0 "The famous Prussian Academy of War has since 1810 been the most prestigious higher school for our officers. However, prestigious does not mean up to date. Our military doctrine has thoroughly changed in the last few years, and while some classics never get old - Clausewitz still saves stressed students - others have fallen out of date. Time to replace them."
GER_security:0 "Institute the Verdeckte Reichspolizei"
GER_security_desc:0 "The Syndicalist terror is nearly as bad again as back in 1928, when Karl von Helfferich, president of the Reichsbank, was shot by a lone gunman. Back then, a countrywide crackdown on terror cells brought some peace, but now the security forces seem unable to do that. There have been propositions to found a new police force, the Verdeckte Reichspolizei, short Verpo, which would act from the shadows."
GER_security_prerequisite:0 "Either §YFranz von Papen§! or §YKurt von Schleicher§! is the head of government."
GER_kaiserbund:0 "The Kaiserbund"
GER_kaiserbund_desc:0 "In light of the ongoing economic stagnation, the Reichstag representatives of the FVP and the NLP have proposed a plan dubbed the Kaiserbund project. It promises to greatly cut expenses of our colonial administration by handing over administration of our colonial empire to local governments in a more loose federation with our home administration..."
GER_security_2:0 "Ban French Organisations"
GER_security_2_desc:0 "The formerly French-controlled regions in the Western parts of Germany have been unruly for a long time. French nationalism is widespread in the population, and French cultural and political organisations exist a plenty. Banning them could suppress French nationalism. Or it could radicalise it. The French will not be happy either way."
GER_security_3:0 "Manoeuvres in Elsaß-Lothringen"
GER_security_3_desc:0 "The despicable Parisians feel bold enough to defy our rule and are supporting insurgents in Lorraine! After extensive talks with the Kaiser and High Command, the Chancellor has approved partial mobilisation of the reserves and is considering massive military exercise in Alsace-Lorraine, including air and armour detachments and military observers from Mitteleuropa member states."
GER_security_4:0 "Put the Syndicalists Back in Their Place"
GER_security_4_desc:0 "The greatest threat to peace and stability in the world is by far the Syndicalists, and they have no greater stronghold than in France. For years, our high command has dreamed of leading troops into Paris again, restoring decency and order in Europe. We should be certain we are prepared, the French will fight more ferociously now than they did in the Weltkrieg, for sure..."
GER_foreign_aid:0 "Aid Our Allies"
GER_foreign_aid_desc:0 "If we want to preserve our Hegemony we must ensure our allies and protectorates throughout the world are strong and loyal. Let us invest in our puppets and colonies."
GER_IRE_deal:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
GER_IRE_deal_desc:0 "The Irish have turned to Germany for protection. We should offer them an aid treaty so that we'll have a loyal ally in the fight against the Union of Britain."
GER_DKB_deal:0 "Military Mission to the Cossacks"
GER_DKB_deal_desc:0 "If we are to keep the Russians in check we must ensure we can combat them on all fronts. Let us send aid to our allies in the Don-Kuban union and help them build their army."
GER_BUR_ALLY:0 "Invite Burma"
GER_BUR_ALLY_desc:0 "The recent invitation of Siam into the Japanese Co-prosperity sphere poses a threat to our large Pacific colonial empire. We can try to counter expansion of Japanese influence through Indochina by allying with Burma, a state threatened from one side by syndicalists and from another by the expansionist Siam. This way we can threaten Siam from the west should a conflict arise."
GER_Mauser_werke:0 "Contracts with Mauser"
GER_Mauser_werke_desc:0 "By sponsoring the Mauser corporation we can increase and improve our small arms production."
GER_mil_expansion_air_1:0 "Construct New Airstrips"
GER_mil_expansion_air_1_desc:0 "By constructing new airports in Wallonia we can get a greater reach over French airspace in case of a war."
GER_mil_expansion:0 "Military Expansion"
GER_mil_expansion_desc:0 "We have won our place in the sun, but if we want to keep it, we must make sure our army is second to none. Let us invest in military research and expansion."
GER_Luftwaffe_fighter:0 "Fighter Focus"
GER_Luftwaffe_fighter_desc:0 "By focusing on fighter research the Luftwaffe will repel all and any enemy incursion into German airspace!"
GER_Luftwaffe_bomber:0 "Bomber Focus"
GER_Luftwaffe_bomber_desc:0 "By focusing on Bombers the Luftwaffe will deliver deadly strikes on enemy industry and supply lines."
GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1:0 "Build More Airbases"
GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1_desc:0 "Build airbases both in the Heimat and outer provinces so that we can set the infrastructure for better defence and offence in the skies."
GER_Henschel_Albatros:0 "Naval Aviation Corps"
GER_Henschel_Albatros_desc:0 "Another result of the untangling of air warfare from ground warfare has been the founding of a group of aviators focused on naval aviation. These pilots, trained in special courses, are now demanding aircraft to fit their special requirements."
GER_Junkers_Fogger:0 "Long-Range Fighters"
GER_Junkers_Fogger_desc:0 "As a result of the Bombergruppen doctrine, the demands on range of operations has multiplied. Theorists and researchers are demanding new aircraft models to keep up with their increasingly aggressive bombardment plans. After the Paris bomber comes the London bomber, after that the Moscow bomber - and there doesn't seem to be an end!"
GER_air_doc:0 "Lessons of the Weltkrieg"
GER_air_doc_desc:0 "The tactics of some twenty years ago, have become severely outdated, in particular in the use of bomber aircraft and how to protect them."
GER_air_doc_2:0 "Modern Air Doctrines"
GER_air_doc_2_desc:0 "By relying on the youngest and brightest minds of the Luftwaffe we can make sure that our air force does not only have the weight of industry behind it, but also the finesse of modern tactics."
GER_mil_expansion_land_1:0 "Militarist Revival"
GER_mil_expansion_land_1_desc:0 "After our victory in the Weltkrieg, the German people grew tired of war and conquest and are feeling content with our power. It is time for us to revive the militaristic spirit of the German people, in the name of the Reich and the Kaiser!"
GER_Infantry_divs:0 "New Weapons"
GER_Infantry_divs_desc:0 "While the German army has the greatest soldiers in the world, it must not lag behind in equipment. Even the greatest of soldier will have a hard time defeating a better equipped enemy."
GER_political_1:0 "Imperial Restructuring"
GER_political_1_desc:0 "While it is undeniable the German empire is the greatest nation to ever grace the pages of history, there is always room for improvement. In light of recent 'shortcomings' of our policies we should look into various changes and reforms we can make for a better future."
GER_black_monday_aftermath:0 "The Aftermath of Black Monday"
GER_black_monday_aftermath_desc:0 "The great stock market crash of 1936, widely known as 'Black Monday', has already had a massive impact on German politics, culture, and society. While the damage might never be fixed, we should enact reforms and recovery policies to regain some of our lost capacity."
GER_mil_industry_2:0 "PEkI I"
GER_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the civilian industry horribly, and the military industry has been affected even worse. Our military supply specialists are clamouring for a program for the extension of war-relevant industries, or Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien, to ensure our military has bullets to fight."
GER_mil_industry_3:0 "PEkI II"
GER_mil_industry_3_desc:0 "The Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien - or abbreviated PEkI, but who would want to abbreviate such a good, German word - is making progress. At least our arsenals don't have to open their last reserves whenever a unit wants to move out anymore. There's still some way to go, but at least we are on the right path."
GER_civ_industry_1:0 "ZIP I"
GER_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is in shambles, with many workers out of a job after their former employers were forced to submit to the crisis. Some of our leading economy researchers have proposed a plan for civil industrialisation, the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan, to revitalise the civilian industrial sector."
GER_civ_industry_2:0 "ZIP II"
GER_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "The first phase of the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan has shown promise, but there is more yet to come. At least some of the worst social and economic disaster has been alleviated, though."
GER_civ_industry_3:0 "ZIP III"
GER_civ_industry_3_desc:0 "With our civilian industry once again strong, but not yet booming, we are required to take just a few more steps. Soon enough German industry will tower above the rest of the world once more, as the steady influx of resources from the colonies assures a massive production boost."
GER_industry_finished:0 "Economic Boom"
GER_industry_finished_desc:0 "With our economic policies following the Black Monday a resounding success, private investors have picked up on the lead, and the economy has not only stabilised, but is currently experiencing a boom of sorts. It won't hold forever, but for the minute, we can concentrate on other issues."
GER_economy:0 "The State of the Economy"
GER_economy_desc:0 "It's good, really. The industry is humming along, the grain is coming in from the eastern member states of Mitteleuropa, many citizens have work. It's looking up for the Kaiserreich, and it seems like nothing will be able to stop the golden age of the late Reichskanzler Tirpitz..."
GER_research_expansion:0 "Extra Research Funding"
GER_research_expansion_desc:0 "Investing in science and technology to stimulate advances in both military and civilian affairs. Isn't that an awfully good phrase? Doesn't really say anything, but it sure sounds good. Anyway, the laboratories are over there..."
GER_ig_farben:0 "Invest In IG Farben"
GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "We can invest in IG Farben, a pharmaceuticals company currently researching ways to synthesise various chemical compounds that might prove useful to our interests."
GER_krupp:0 "Friedrich Krupp AG Monopoly"
GER_krupp_desc:0 "The Krupp dynasty is an almost 400-year-old Dynasty of Industrious Germans, who has fed the German war machine ever since the Thirty Years' War! It is time we put them in state employment again, as their talents will be badly needed with a new Weltkrieg on the horizon."
GER_artillery_research:0 "Artillery research"
GER_artillery_research_desc:0 "An area in which the German army has a long and standing tradition of lagging behind is the area of light support artillery. While the successes in building huge, unwieldy and impractical prestige objects such as the 'Paris Gun' can't be doubted, it's time to invest in some of the more practical - and more efficient - alternatives."
GER_doctrine_armor:0 "Armoured Breakthrough"
GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Another crucial point of Guderians and Mansteins new doctrine is the so-called Schwerpunkt. They believe that Panzer technology has advanced to a point where amassed, mobile Panzer forces, with adequately equipped support troops, should be able to lead any offensive to victory. Now they need new Panzers to fit this idea."
GER_hahn_meitner:0 "Support Einstein & Meitner"
GER_hahn_meitner_desc:0 "Herr Einstein and Fräulein Meitner are both extremely talented physicists; Einstein is regularly published in science journals even in the Syndicalist bloc, and Meitner is a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute! Together, we believe, the two can help create extremely powerful tools for society. And even more powerful weapons."
GER_rocket:0 "Support von Braun"
GER_rocket_desc:0 "Von Braun is a notorious proponent for the field of 'Rocketry' and is the most accredited scientist for the field worldwide. He comes to us with the offer of new weaponised designs in return for sponsorship. We should heavily consider this."
GER_zuse:0 "Support Konrad Zuse"
GER_zuse_desc:0 "Konrad Zuse has already handed in several patents for what he calls a 'computing devices'. With proper sponsorship, his mind could be put to good use by the state, for the state."
GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society:0 "The Kaiser Wilhelm Society"
GER_kaiser_wilhelm_society_desc:0 "Recent investments in the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science have resulted in greater research capacity in various fields. If we officially endorse and promote the society as a place for state-sponsored research for state purposes, we should be able to attract some of the brightest minds of the new generation."
GER_black_monday_radio:0 "The Kanzler and the Radio"
GER_black_monday_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the Germans' belief in their country. Reichskanzler von Papen hopes to turn the tide with weekly radio addresses in which he will announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis."
GER_groener1:0 "Liquidate unprofitable estates"
GER_groener1_desc:0 "The statesman Wilhelm Groener has recently published an essay titled 'The black zero: the need for austerity', in which he demands absolute balance discipline, even if it means losing some companies depending on subsidies. The essay has found a lot of adherents within the populace, and liquidating a few unprofitable companies may be just what we need to alleviate our expenditures."
GER_groener2:0 "Reichsarbeitsdienst"
GER_groener2_desc:0 "The contacts and friends of Groener among military circles have now proposed a radical innovation: For the duration of the crisis, recruits will be able to choose to fulfil half a year of military service as manual labourers in state service instead. While bad for recruitment numbers, this will inject some needed lobar into our economy."
GER_groener3:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
GER_groener3_desc:0 "The island of Ceylon is a very unprofitable part of our colonial empire, requiring massive investment every year. However, there have been proposals of selling the island to the Princely Federation - without doubt a profitable idea."
GER_schacht1:0 "Bail out Junker Estates"
GER_schacht1_desc:0 "The president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, demands to be given green light to go ahead with his economic program, dubbed the 'Schachtplan': According to him, we need to bail out the highly indebted Junker estates if we don't want to trigger an even further descent into chaos."
GER_schacht2:0 "Investitionsprogramm"
GER_schacht2_desc:0 "The next part of the Schachtplan would be a massive program aiming to encourage private investment, both into businesses as into consumer products. While this will be hard to achieve, it should enable producers to find a market for their products again, which will hopefully restart the economy."
GER_schacht3:0 "Approach Poland"
GER_schacht3_desc:0 "With the economy slowly finding its track again, the time has maybe come to finally include Poland into the customs-free zone formed by Mitteleuropa. There has been some enthusiasm about this proposal in some circles; Especially the Zentrum politician Heinrich von Brentano has been a leading proposer of the idea."
GER_mitteleuropa:0 "One Currency for Mitteleuropa"
GER_mitteleuropa_desc:0 "Now that Heinrich von Brentano and his friends of the European Friendship association have found their way into upper government circles, he has proposed another of his ideas: A common currency, shared by all Mitteleuropean countries. This would, of course, never work. European friendship? What a silly idea."
GER_synthetic:0 "Research in Synthetics"
GER_synthetic_desc:0 "The IG Farben researchers have, in cooperation with members of the Kaiser Wilhelm society, been able to make astounding breakthroughs on the area of synthetic production already. By giving them access to some more funds, we might be able to make their research ready for mass implementation."
GER_experimental_research:0 "Experimental research"
GER_experimental_research_desc:0 "While we have already made good progress in some of the more traditional fields relevant to industry - engineering, chemistry, physics - some of our scientists want funding to conduct research into some more esoteric matters. Profit might not be as immediate as so far, but the potential is immense!"
GER_black_monday_finish:0 "Finish Black Monday reforms"
GER_black_monday_finish_desc:0 "It seemed impossible, but the numbers confirm it; The crisis is nearing its end. Nearing its end, that is. There are still millions without jobs, and civil society has been stretched to its very end. The catastrophe of Black Monday will leave marks for a long time, but this is the beginning of the end."
GER_organize_the_youth:0 "Organise the Youth"
GER_organize_the_youth_desc:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness in our nations youth would be organising them so that they can learn new skills and use their energies for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."
GER_a_christian_trade_union:0 "A Christian Trade Union"
GER_a_christian_trade_union_desc:0 "By founding the Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund as a state-endorsed union, we will hopefully establish a bulwark against attacks on the workers' loyalty from left and right. Workers will be able to voice their concerns under the moral authority of priests and the guiding hand of the 'summus episcopus'; The Kaiser."
GER_jet:0 "Cult of Aviation"
GER_jet_desc:0 "The image of the aviator has changed in the current conflict. They have replaced the cavalry as the image of the glorious and gallant war; Every child aspires to be an aviator and streak across the skies in his shining armour. By further fostering this image, we can motivate our pilots to give their very best in the service of the Reich."
GER_linie1:0 "Reactivate the Ludendorfflinie"
GER_linie1_desc:0 "The Syndicalist menace looms darker than ever. In fear of going into the next war unprepared, the reactivation of the old Ludendorfflinie has been considered. Once one of the dictators many costly prestige projects, the line of bunkers and fortifications has fallen into disuse the last years - but that's nothing that can't be solved with a bit of engineering ingenuity!"
GER_linie2_full:0 "Over the Meuse and far away"
GER_linie2_full_desc:0 "Our puppet regime in Brüssel is screaming for help against the Syndicalists. Extending the reactivation of the Ludendorfflinie over the Meuse river, up to the North Sea coast, would be costly and take lots of precious time - but it might enable us to make a stand somewhere that isn't Germany."
GER_linie2_small:0 "Modernise only Bastenach"
GER_linie2_small_desc:0 "Our resources are stretched thin and time is of the essence. Even though Flanders-Wallonia may lie somewhat under-defended, we can't afford to waste time defending something that will be lost sooner or later anyway."
GER_linie3:0 "Fortify the Rhineland"
GER_linie3_desc:0 "The Rhineland is the most heavily industrialised region in the entire world and vital to our economy, both in peace as in war. And yet, it lies only a few miles away from a border many have been eyeing nervously the last few weeks. In order to prepare against any eventualities, we should start extending the Ludendorflinie northwards."
GER_schule:0 "Paderborner Luftkriegsschule"
GER_schule_desc:0 "The establishment of a formalised school for our aviators would help immensely in unifying and promoting this currently somewhat disorganised field. There are a lot of heroes of air warfare from the Weltkrieg, the most famous of course being the Red Baron himself, whose insight can still be valuable to new recruits; There, they could teach what they know."
GER_institut:0 "Institut für Luftfahrttechnik"
GER_institut_desc:0 "An independent research organisation for aviation technology, the Institut für Luftfahrttechnik, could prove a major stepping stone on the way to ensuring German dominance not only on the ground and on the sea, but also in the skies."
GER_heerflieger:0 "Keep the Fliegertruppe"
GER_heerflieger_desc:0 "Our aviators are currently organised as parts of our army structure, without an independent air force command. This boosts cooperation between aviators and ground troops, and therefore leads to the current doctrine concentrating on just that; air support with ground force primacy. This is good and should stay that way."
GER_luftwaffe:0 "Establish an independent Luftwaffe"
GER_luftwaffe_desc:0 "The Red Baron, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, has since the Weltkrieg been arguing for the establishment of an independent air force - the Luftwaffe, as he likes to call it. Up to very recently, the conservative elements in the traditionally more prestigious ground forces have been able to prohibit this, but with war looming once again, it might be time to consider the Baron's idea."
GER_sturzflieger:0 "Sturzflieger"
GER_sturzflieger_desc:0 "One concept that has recently found a lot of supporters among aviation researchers is that of an aircraft that dives from great heights onto the battlefield to deliver its payload, using its momentum to climb again immediately afterwards. This concept, dubbed Sturzflieger, would minimise the time our precious aircraft would be in immediate danger."
GER_cas:0 "Coordinated Close Air Support"
GER_cas_desc:0 "The requirements and possible uses of close air support aircraft have proven to be far different from those of more main-stream fighter aircraft. If we concentrate or air research capabilities on identifying and exploiting these little intricacies of this specialised from of air warfare, we should be able to achieve far better results in aircraft manufacturing."
GER_para:0 "Found the Luftlandetruppe"
GER_para_desc:0 "And back to combined air force and ground operations we go; There have been propositions of greatly expanding our Paratrooper division, which is currently in its infancy. This might have to do something with the fact that jumping from a flying plane does not seem very glorious or entertaining - or survivable, really. We should promote the image of the paratrooper as the spearhead of the military."
GER_bombergruppen:0 "Bombergruppen Doctrine"
GER_bombergruppen_desc:0 "One of the first results of the founding of Richthofens Luftwaffe has been the invention of a new doctrine. This doctrine asserts that the possibilities of massed bomber warfare are large enough to warrant primacy over the traditional ground support. Fighters should be used not on the ground, were they are subject to anti-air attacks, but in the skies to escort bomber squadrons."
GER_singapore_airstrips:0 "Expand Singapur Airstrips"

GER_finalise_centralisation:0 "Finalise Centralisation"
GER_finalise_centralisation_desc:0 "The independent post departments of the kingdoms of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany are one of the last remnants of the federal structure of Germany. By finally expanding the responsibilities of the German post department to these countries, we could set an end to all those damaging particularist tendencies. Germany is not something you can opt out of!"
GER_disband_reichstag:0 "Disband the Reichstag"
GER_disband_reichstag_desc:0 "Reichskanzler von Schleicher has succeeded. The DVLP is once again the most influential party in Germany and Junkers occupy all important posts. The only thing left to do is to formalise the new regime in the same way as Erich von Ludendorff did it in 1919; Dissolve and suspend the Reichstag for an undetermined amount of time, to bring peace, freedom, justice and security to this new Kaiserreich."
GER_sonderweg:0 "The German Sonderweg"
GER_sonderweg_desc:0 "Our path from Aristocracy to Democracy has been unlike another within Europe and this is keenly reaffirmed within the new Sonderweg school of thought. We should embrace these Democratic ideas as much as we can."

GER_parlamentsvertrauen:0 "An End to Prussian Constitutionalism"
GER_parlamentsvertrauen_desc:0 "After more than sixty years of battle against the authoritarian elements of the German establishment, the time has finally come to make Germany a democracy at last. From now on, the Reichskanzler and his government will no longer report to the Kaiser, but to the Reichstag and the people; There will be no more government against, but only of the people, by the people, for the people."
GER_democracy_in_prussia:0 "Democracy in Prussia"
GER_democracy_in_prussia_desc:0 "The current voting system in Prussia is archaic and undemocratic.

We should finally implement universal, secret and equal franchise for all citizens of Germany."

GER_easter_promises_desc:0 "On April 7th 1917, when the war was at its very worst, after the horrifying 'Turnip Winter', the Kaiser promised substantial reforms and the abolition of the three-class voting system in Prussia.

GER_women_suffrage:0 "Women's Suffrage"
GER_women_suffrage_desc:0 "While the Prussians now finally have their universal, secret and equal franchise, the women of Germany are still exempt from the vote. Awareness of this issue has been steadily rising, and clubs modeled on the British suffragettes are recruiting new members. If we want to avoid the public embarrassment that the British suffered in that affair, we should maybe consider fulfilling their requests."
GER_schleicher:0 "Schleicher's Kamarilla"
GER_schleicher_desc:0 "The Kaiser made von Schleicher Reichskanzler due to his promises to secure Germany against threats both from the democrats as well as the Junkers. However, now that he has his office, Schleicher has been restaffing important offices and making contracts with Junker companies, and some people whisper about a sinister plan to get the Junker into power after all..."

GER_restore_country_rights:0 "Restore the Bundesrat"
GER_restore_country_rights_desc:0 "Under the Ludendorff regime, many of the privileges of the constituent countries of Germany were abolished. The largest of these insults was the formal dissolution of the Bundesrat, the chamber where delegates from all countries can voice their concerns and vote on empire-wide legislature. By reinstating this organisation, we would send a powerful signal to the countries of Germany."

However, on movies as far removed from politics as possible, is anything but supportive of the state. Some producers, namely Leni Riefenstahl, have proposed some projects that, with our funding, could help remind the Germans of their glorious past and future."
GER_siemens:0 "Subsidies for Siemens"
GER_siemens_desc:0 "Siemens is one of the many middle-to-larger sized businesses that form the heart of the German economy.

GER_poland_alliance:0 "Deepen ties to Poland"
GER_poland_alliance_desc:0 "Our initial forays into improving diplomatic ties with Poland have been met with some amount of success.

### Leader descriptions ###

GER_WILHELM_DESC:0 "Considered by some to be a sort of 'Male Victoria' or the 'Father of Mitteleuropa', Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern has been the ruler of the German Empire for almost 50 years. His reign is already considered to be the 'German Golden Age' - after the Weltkrieg, Germany has grown to become the leading nation in Europe, surpassing all of its rivals, and its drive to acquire a place in the sun has been fulfilled. Even if dark clouds loom over the horizon, the people support Kaiser Wilhelm, and he has gained the support of his country."

### Domestic Events ###

gerdom.1.t:0 "The Constitution of the German Kaiserreich"
gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the North German Federation and of four Southern German states. This constitution put the Southern German states under the influence of the North German Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich. \n\nAccording to the constitution, the empire was a federation of 25 German states. The Bundespräsidium was held by the King of Prussia, who had the title of German Emperor. The Emperor appointed the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws were enacted by the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years. \n\nHowever, it is the Emperor, not the Bundesrat or the Reichstag, who leads the power in the German Empire. With an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained unchanged since 1849. \n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with this status of things and our constitution may see large revisions in the next few years..."
gerdom.1.a:0 "A constitution guarantees stability, at least."

gerdom.2.t:0 "Hans von Seeckt dies"
gerdom.2.d:0 "Our Chief of General Staff, Hans von Seeckt, has died today in Berlin. The hero of the Intervention in China passed away peacefully in his sleep. \n\nOur nation is mourning the loss of a true German hero, and all important dignitaries were in attendance at his funeral in Berlin. Afterwards, the Chief of the Army, August von Mackensen, could be seen whispering something to the Kaiser."
gerdom.2.a:0 "I wonder what he is up to?"

gerdom.4.t:0 "Problems with Grain Supply"
gerdom.4.d:0 "With parts of our grain supply in the Baltic and the Ukraine no longer under our control, we have encountered severe problems. Let's hope this does not escalate as far as the horrible hunger winter of 1916/17..."
gerdom.4.a:0 "Scheisse!"

### Sale of Ceylon ###

gerdom.7.t:0 "The Status of Ceylon"
gerdom.7.d:0 "-"
gerdom.7.a:0 "Keep Ceylon under our control"
gerdom.7.b:0 "Grant natives autonomous status within German Empire"
gerdom.7.c:0 "Offer Ceylon to the Princely Federation"

gerdom.8.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
gerdom.8.d:0 "The Germans have come to us offering us the sale of Ceylon. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in Indian Ocean. What shall our reply be?"
gerdom.8.a:0 "Welcome home, Ceylon!"
gerdom.8.b:0 "We do not need that rock"

gerdom.9.t:0 "The Sale of Ceylon"
gerdom.9.d:0 "Ambassador of the Princely Federation has sent a message to us declaring that government has agreed to buy Ceylon. We have begun to transfer control over island to them."
gerdom.9.a:0 "Great"

gerdom.10.t:0 "The Princely Federation refused our offer"
gerdom.10.d:0 "The Princely Federation has replied to our offer flatly stating that they do not want Ceylon. We can now only keep things as they are or allow natives more autonomy. What shall we do?"

### Agricultural crisis in Mitteleuropa ###

gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the agricultural sector of German economy is one of the most vulnerable to turmoil. With this in mind, several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and subsidies to their production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this important sector of the Reich's economy. Such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, however, as they are greatly dependant in trade with Germany. The wheat crops in the Ukraine are particularly vulnerable."
gerdom.11.a:0 "We must protect our own peasants."
gerdom.11.b:0 "Promise help..."

gerdom.12.t:0 "The increasing activity of the suffragist movement"
gerdom.12.d:0 "Lately there has been a rise in activity of the supporters of women's suffrage, that is those who want to grant women the right to vote and to run for office. In this troubled times for the German Empire, it is not easy to choose the best solution. Granting them what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, especially the members of the Reichstag (currently elected by universal male suffrage). On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to riots and more protests, especially in the more liberal states (that already permitted female voting in regional assemblies)..."
gerdom.12.a:0 "A cause worth supporting!"
gerdom.12.b:0 "Promise something, do nothing."
gerdom.12.c:0 "Don't they have enough already?!"

gerdom.13.t:0 "German women demand recognition for their war effort"
gerdom.13.d:0 "In the great war against the French syndicalist, German women have proven their loyalty and support for the Empire. Some of them proved fundamental for our propaganda efforts and many of them started working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence. For these reason, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again the government to grant women the right to vote and to run for office."
gerdom.13.a:0 "Will they never stop?"

gerdom.92.d:0 "This is the darkest hour of the German Empire. Defeated by the planes, tanks and tactics of a superior enemy, the Imperial government has evacuated Berlin and is currently converging, shell-shocked and delusional, in Dar es Salaam. However, the army is not Germany! And under the African Skies our loyal colonies remain committed to the war-effort. But the government is facing suspicions for presiding over the greatest military catastrophe to ever occur to Germany and army officers are demanding a new emergency chancellor to be appointed. Many of them are clamouring for Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to be elevated to this position, given his successes in the Weltkrieg and the loyalty and affection he commands among the askaris."
gerdom.92.a:0 "Yes! Appoint von Lettow-Vorbeck! Heia Safari!"
gerdom.92.b:0 "NO! This would be the last nail in the coffin of our democracy!"

gerdom.93.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck Proposes to Raise an 'Afrikakorps'"
gerdom.93.d:0 "Chancellor von Lettow-Vorbeck has proposed to the emergency government that the German state raise additional units of native schutztruppen, also known as askaris. These doughty soldiers have served the Reich faithfully ever since the chancellor outwitted the Entente in the East African jungles during the Weltkrieg. Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck also proposes that we present the leaders of the various sub-states of Mittelafrika with the prospect of complete independence as a reward for their services to the Imperial dynasty and its government. This is a desperate proposal, but the Reich are going through desperate times."
gerdom.93.a:0 "Rally the askaris from all of Mittelafrika!"
gerdom.93.b:0 "Useless, we need German troops for a German war!"

gerdom.94.t:0 "Afrikakorps - Südwestafrika"
gerdom.94.d:0 "One of the first German colonies, Südwestafrika has proven especially loyal to the imperial government. However, its close connection with the founding of the German colonial empire might make it difficult for conservatives within our cabinet to accept the prospect of independence promised by von Lettow-Vorbeck."
gerdom.94.a:0 "Announce our commitment to African autonomy - if we win!"

gerdom.95.t:0 "Afrikakorps - Deutsch-Ostafrika"
gerdom.95.d:0 "The site of some of the most impressive and victorious battles fought by the German colonial army under von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg, Ostafrika with its capital of Dar-es-Salaam is seen by most as the jewel within the crown of the Reich's African colonial empire. As such the German administration is thoroughly entrenched and cooperation with the natives run smoothly, resulting in a large turnout of volunteers for the new Schutztruppen."

gerdom.96.t:0 "Afrikakorps - Deutsch-Kongo"
gerdom.96.d:0 "Taken from the Belgian state after the Weltkrieg, the Congo occupies the heart of Central Africa and has been for the last decades of German administration been heavily militarised to secure the Reich's control over the province."

gerdom.97.t:0 "Afrikakorps - Äquatorialafrika"
gerdom.97.d:0 "Strategically located to the immediate south of the Sahara, the colony of German Equatorial Africa deploys some of the most impressive auxiliary troops."

gerdom.98.t:0 "Afrikakorps - Niger-Kamerun"
gerdom.98.d:0 "One of the more recent acquired African provinces, Niger was merged with the German colony of Kamerun in the Mitelafrikan state. Though united, the natives stand ready to earn their independence in the pay of the Reich!"
gerdom.99.t:0 "Afrikakorps - Togoland"
gerdom.99.d:0 "Consisting of the original German colony of Togo and the annexed British and French colonies of the Gold Coast and Dahomey, the askaris formed here are of a notably lesser quality than seen elsewhere in Mittelafrika."

gerdom.100.t:0 "Decolonisation of German Africa"
gerdom.100.d:0 "In the darkest hour of the German Empire, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck rallied the colonial askaris behind the Reich by promising them independence once the war had been won. Our enemies have been crushed and Berlin liberated, leading to many of our African subjects humbly asking us to uphold our promises and commence the decolonisation of our domains in Africa."
gerdom.100.a:0 "We shall uphold our promises!"
gerdom.100.b:0 "Africa shall remain German forevermore!"

### Security ###

gerdom.105.t:0 "Germany Suppresses its French Population!"
gerdom.105.d:0 "The German Empire, afraid of the rising power of our state decided to tighten control in border region, since they are fearful of our growing influence! We must be patient, soon the time will come, when our brothers in Wallonia, Lorraine and Alsace shall be liberated!"
gerdom.105.a:0 "Soon, our time shall come!"

gerdom.106.t:0 "Further increasing our internal security"
gerdom.106.d:0 "Despite gradual increase of military and police presence in our border region, it is still not enough. Underground French syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning minds of our French minority with syndicalist propaganda using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, part of right wing political circles demand complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation among international community..."
gerdom.106.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient!"
gerdom.106.b:0 "It's the time to ban all French organisations in Germany!"
gerdom.106.c:0 "This plan was madness from the beginning, abandon it..."

### Rhenish Syndicalist Volunteers ###

gerdom.200.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht asks for visa"
gerdom.200.d:0 "For some time now, Syndicalists sympathisers from the Rhineland have been going abroad to help their 'comrades' in their various conflicts around the world. Today, the famous underground writer Bertolt Brecht has announced his intent to join these 'International Divisions'. \n\n We could let him go, which would most likely inspire quite another few Syndicalists to go abroad after him, or we could confiscate his passport and prohibit him from leaving the country. It would maybe weaken the Syndicalist cause, but also cause tremendous outrage..."
gerdom.200.aa:0 "Let him go to wild America..."
gerdom.200.ab:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants..."
gerdom.200.ac:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants..."
gerdom.200.ad:0 "Let's hope he freezes in Russia!"
gerdom.200.ae:0 "He can sweat in Spain..."
gerdom.200.af:0 "He will reconsider."

gerdom.201.t:0 "German Volunteers arrive!"
gerdom.201.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"

gerdom.204.t:0 "German Volunteers arrive!"
gerdom.204.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.204.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.205.t:0 "The Rhineland is silent"
gerdom.205.d:0 "With many of the worst troublemakers abroad to fight and hopefully die, the Rhineland, for many years the region were Syndicalist unrest was the worst, is finally seeing some peace and quiet."
gerdom.205.a:0 "Let's hope things stay this way..."

gerdom.206.t:0 "Syndicalist Sympathisers want to return home"
gerdom.206.d:0 "Now that their war has been lost, the 'International Divisions' formed from our volunteers are trying to return to their homes. Many still have their arms and all survivors are battle-hardened, indoctrinated Syndicalists. However, if we prohibit them from entering over our borders, we should be able to keep them away without to big of a scandal. But we might risk them turning against us if we ever come to to blows with the Internationale..."
gerdom.206.a:0 "They'll have to serve their term in the Heer!"
gerdom.206.b:0 "They can return to their families."
gerdom.206.c:0 "Close the borders!"

gerdom.207.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht is dead"
gerdom.207.d:0 "After assumptions had already been made for weeks, we now have the official confirmation: Our German Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has died in some rotten cellar, most likely in the hands of a policeman. After serving in as Syndicalist volunteer, Brecht was captured some time after the end of the war. \n\n His family, together with other Syndicalist elements, staged large-scale demonstrations centred around Berlin in his support, blaming our policy of not letting the veterans return home for his death."
gerdom.207.a:0 "It seems we created a martyr."

gerdom.208.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht has returned home"
gerdom.208.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems like the Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has somehow managed to smuggle himself over the border. He and his family have gone underground and are openly practising the battle against the Capitalist system..."
gerdom.208.a:0 "Can't he ever shut up?!"

gerdom.209.t:0 "The International Divisions offer their service"
gerdom.209.d:0 "After valiantly fighting for the Syndicalist cause, the comrades and veterans of the International Divisions have cowardly been denied asylum back into their home country. After some time of drifting, many of the former members have now decided to take up arms for the liberation of their homeland from the Monarchists! While their numbers have been reduced by fighting and poverty, they are battle-hardened veterans and would make a worthy addition to the army of the Internationale."
gerdom.209.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
gerdom.209.b:0 "Ughhh... but that's expensive..."

gerfor.1.d:0 "The combined forces of the Union of Britain have launched an invasion of Denmark. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the syndicalist alliance, and the Danish government has asked for our help.

gerfor.10.d.sri:0 "Drawing [FRA.GetNameDef] into our war with [ITA.GetNameDef] was perhaps not the wisest idea. The war drew Germany's attention, who issued an ultimatum to [FRA.GetNameDef] to cease the invasion - and the [FRA.GetAdjective] government has complied, ordering our own forces to stand down. We have little choice but to comply."

gerfor.11.t:0 "The Syndicalists back down"

gerfor.44.t:0 "Germany offers us a treaty"
gerfor.44.d:0 "The German ambassador has approached us today with an offer: If Ireland agrees to join Mitteleuropa Germany would invest in our economy and military. While the benefits from this deal would be great there are some in the government who are unwilling to rely on foreign aid..."

Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the state secretary on war was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While general von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughter's doings, the real question for von Schleicher was - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - by whom?"

Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed into celebrating the foundation of the Reich, and after the Weltkrieg the defeat of those forces that tried to destroy it. \n\nThroughhout every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobility, soldiers and unnumbered veterans parade proudly through the streets, cheered by the happy masses. Indeed, this is a good day, a day that reminds us of the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed since the forging of the Reich."

gerfla.6.t:0 "Erich von Ludendorff dies"
gerfla.6.d:0 "Even after his death was reported early this morning, Erich von Ludendorff remains one of the most controversial persons in recent German history. On one hand he was a hero of the Weltkrieg, the orchestrator of German victory in 1919. On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten his ensuing military dictatorship, that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924. Although Ludendorff still received some honours for his service, like his knighthood, the former quartermaster-general mostly led a secluded life at his estate afterwards."

Succeeding von Bethmann-Hollweg as Imperial Chancellor in 1917, the first and until now the only commoner to have acceded to the post of German chancellor, he was considered by many as the stooge of the Hindenburg-Ludendorff dictatorship, being forced to resign and replaced by Hindenburg after Ludendorff grew dissatisfied with him in 1919. As a former Reichskanzler, he received a state funeral, but the Kaiser refused to attend."

As the eight Chancellor and Commander of the German Navy Tirpitz led the Kaiserreich out of the Ludendorff dictatorship, initiating the Golden Age that lasted through the Twenties until his death. \n\nAfter his death, his Deutsche Vaterlandspartei (German Fatherland party, DVLP), reformed into the Junker party it is today under their new leader, Alfred Hugenberg, opening the way for the von Papen's Deutschkonservative Partei (German Conservative Party, DKP). And while the Reich enjoyed prosperity under his reign, he also continued o hold off on fulfilling the Kaiser's Easter Promises from 1917, leaving us with some troubles in the past years. \n\nStill, his prestige is enormous, and the anniversary of his death has been accompanied by public demonstrations of respect all across the Empire."

Notable examples include the diary of Sergant Adolf Hitler, a signalman who amongst other distinctions was awarded no less than two Iron Crosses for his valour on the Western and Eastern fronts. \n\nThe diaries provide a unique and fiery insight into the nature of the bitter ideological struggle. What better way to re-affirm the values and continuing glory of the Reich in these troubled times?"

'Unser Kampf' boasts the highest production values hitherto seen - made possible by state investments into the Babelsberg studios - and offers a frighteningly real depiction of the war. Starring Heinz Ruhmann, Hans Albers and Theodor Loos, the story focuses on the heroism and dedication of the 'small people' in the Weltkrieg, such as the valiant corporal Adolf Hitler, who sacrificed everything for his Kaiser and the Reich."

As Crete was ours before we lost the Weltkrieg, the majority of the ministers are pushing to annex the Cretan state. However, a few men are calling for only an indirect subordination of Crete. What shall we do?"
gerdom.277.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."

gerdom.284.d:0 "With our decision to implement the Kaiserbund project we still have to decide extent of its implementation on various strategical points under our control. One such point is the island of Crete. The island has had a turbulent history, and many foreign groups are interested in it, we may be able to defend the island better under local leadership, then again, another 'unsinkable aircraft carrier' wouldn't go amiss."
gerdom.284.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy"
gerdom.284.b:0 "Keep them under our direct control"
