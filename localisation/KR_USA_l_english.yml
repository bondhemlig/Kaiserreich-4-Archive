### National Focus - Presidents ###
USA_1936_election:0 "The 1936 Election"
USA_1936_election_desc:0 "The 1936 elections are the most ideological fraught elections in US history to date. Syndicalists and Nationalists, Republicans and Democrats all battle it out at the ballot box to see who will become the President of the United States of America. In the end though only one can be president."
USA_president_reed:0 "President Reed"
USA_president_reed_desc:0 "Against even the Combined Syndicates' wildest hopes, Jack Reed has been elected as the 32nd President of the United States. His victory shocks not just America but the whole country. The syndicalists and their allies are jubilant at his success, while shouts of Red Traitor erupt throughout the country from those in the center and the right galvanizing them already against him. This most unexpected outcome seems to be setting the US on the path of gradual democratic socialism, that is if they can avoid any conflicts."
USA_labor_relations_act:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
USA_labor_relations_act_desc:0 "One of Reed's first acts as President is to push for the Labor-Relations Act. The act would help guarantee the rights of Unions from Collective Bargaining to Strike Action. This Act has surprisingly quite bit more support, particularly from the progressive wings of the Democrats and Republican. The conservatives in Congress however decry it as destroying American Capitalism."
USA_workers_security:0 "Syndicalist Social Security"
USA_workers_security_desc:0 "After the passage of the Labor-Relations Act in Congress, Jack Reed has set his sight on creating social security for all Americans. In contrast to the Labor-Relations Act, this has meet with criticism by even some of the progressive wings of the Democratic and Republican parties, still there is plenty of support for the Act that has already been dubbed, Syndicalist Social Security."
USA_resource_nationalization:0 "Resource Nationalization Act"
USA_resource_nationalization_desc:0 "After the Passage of the Social Security Act, Reed has set his sight on nationalizing the resources of America for Americans. However the resources nationalization act has already met with stiff resistance by some and out right hostility from others. Reed and the syndicalists are determined to push it through  though..."
USA_president_long:0 "President Long"
USA_president_long_desc:0 "Against all odds, Huey Long has been elected the 32nd President of the United States.  The Southern Demagogue is feared by his opponents but beloved by the rural poor and a significant portion of the disillusioned former-progressives of the middle class. He promises the world to his followers and shows little regard for the Constitution, but that is apparently enough to win election."
USA_long_farmer_relief:0 "Farmer Relief act"
USA_long_farmer_relief_desc:0 "One of the first acts that Long wishes to push through Congress is a farmer relief bill that would help the farmers throughout the country. The Syndicalists throughout the country counter that this reform doesn't go far enough while conservatives counter it goes to far. Yet despite this, it seems to be rather popular throughout the country.	"

USA_president_garner:0 "President Garner"
USA_president_garner_desc:0 "John Nancy Garner has been elected the 32nd President of the United States. A polarizing but decisive pick, Garner is the ex-Speaker of the House from the Democrats and brings years of legislative experience along with a conservative aggression hitherto unseen in America.  Garner vows from the start to protect the status quo by any means necessary, and will tolerate neither populism nor true Syndicalism. "
USA_expand_the_fbi:0 "Expand the FBI"
USA_expand_the_fbi_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover has approached Garner seeking to have more funding and support for the FBI. He argues that this support will allow the federal agents to help root out any domestic enemies to America. They can go every where in the country, especially the regions where the syndicalists and nationalists are dominant. "
USA_alien_sedition_acts:0 "Espionage and Sedition Act"
USA_alien_sedition_acts_desc:0 "Garner and Congress are active to punish all those who would rebel against the United States.  With this new bill, dissent and even significant civilian support for rebel groups is punishable as sedition and possibly treason, and the punishments are harsh.  This is strongly opposed by the CSA and American First within Congress, however the times require such a move."
USA_return_to_normalcy:0 "Return to Normalacy"
USA_return_to_normalcy_desc:0 "The elections over and now it is time for politics to be put aside and people return to normalcy. The bitter partisan election is over it is time to get back to what made America great. Congress has taken this up with zeal. Critics though argue that this was just an excuse to have a red scare against the syndicalists and nationalists. "

### Event text ###
  ustates.1.t:0 "A Day In September"
  ustates.1.d:0 "The social and political consensus in American society has broken down, and the current Presidential Election Campaign is like nothing we have ever seen. The America First-Union party is organising right-wing militias in the South and Mid-West, and Syndicalists control the streets of Chicago and Detroit. To avoid a complete breakdown of our society, some of our senior military commanders believe that it may be necessary to suspend the Constitution and cancel the election."
  ustates.1.a:0 "The elections must go ahead."
  ustates.1.b:0 "Invite the military to step in to save the country!"
  
  ustates.2.t:0 "Emergency Security Act"
  ustates.2.d:0 "MacArthur's first act was to reestablish order on the streets of America. He proposed the Emergency Security Act which would give MacArthur the power to arrest and detain suspected members of un-American organisations. This was a thin cover for MacArthurs anti-socialist agenda, and with the support of the America First it was more than likely going to be enacted."
  ustates.2.a:0 "Pass the act."
  ustates.2.b:0 "This is still a democracy!" 
  
  ustates.3.t:0 "The Fourth of July"
  ustates.3.d_normal:0 "On Independence Day, the Fourth of July, celebrations took place today all across the country. Nearly everyone has set aside their political differences to celebrate the traditions of the United States with fireworks, parades, barbecues, beer, picnics, and baseball games."
  ustates.3.d_cw:0 "This was the first July 4th of the war and many were apprehensive about whether there would be more July 4th's under the cloud of war. The people of America did celebrate the day with more vigour than they had before because it had true meaning to the spirit of American democracy!"
  ustates.3.d_mcarthur:0 "Independence Day, also known as the Fourth of July, celebrations took place today all across the country. People remember the freedoms which were once theirs but which were taken from them during the civil war..."
  ustates.3.a:0 "We shall celebrate the democratic ideals!"
  ustates.3.b:0 "Independence Day" 
  ustates.3.c:0 "Democracy will be restored" 
  
  ustates.4.t:0 "The Indian Citizenship Act of 1936"
  ustates.4.d:0 "In order to gain more sympathy from the North and the West, it has been proposed by the Senate and the House that a Indian Citizenship Act be passed, effectively elevating all indigenous peoples of the United States from second-class citizens to full citizenship."
  ustates.4.a:0 "Pass the Act, hopefully this will gain us some sympathy!"
  ustates.4.b:0 "Veto the Bill." 
  
  ustates.5.t:0 "The Battle of the Overpass"
  ustates.5.d:0 "In Detroit, Michigan, the Automotive Capital of the World, Walter Reuther and Richard Frankensteen, the leaders of the United Auto Workers association, called a general strike against the Ford Motor Company and proclaim themselves for 'Unionism, Not Fordism', demanding higher pay and less hours for automotive workers. \n\nAt 2:00 PM today, a photographer from the Detroit Free Press asked to take a photo of the leaders of the UAW standing on the overpass with the Ford sign in the background. While they were posing, a group of forty men from the Ford's Service Department, approached them from behind and began to beat up on them with their batons. The group then continued their attack on some of the beret-wearing women present to pass out leaflets."
  ustates.5.a:0 "This will hurt us more than it hurt the Unionists!"

  ustates.6.d:0 "A Heat Wave has struck the continental United States and Canada. The most severe heat wave in the Modern History of North America, 'The Great Heat Wave' started in late June, and went up over 100°F (38°C) as drought conditions worsened due to a continued lack of rain. Now, in July, the heat has reached all time records. In Steele, North Dakota, temperatures have reached 121°F (50°C). In Ohio, temperatures have reached 110°F (43°C), which was close to tying a record high set in 1934. \n\nThis comes in a time of major political unrest, with the America First Council a major force in Midwest Politics, and Socialist and Syndicalist mobs and militias gathering arms in the Great Lakes region. The drought is continuing, and over 3,000 reported deaths have been linked to it. Many people are suffering from heat stroke and heat exhaustion. Farmers across the continent saw their worst harvest on record, causing corn and wheat prices to skyrocket, and this Heat Wave does not seem to be giving up any time soon."

The rivers and their tributaries had already been over their banks, and were now threatening the city of Pittsburgh. On March 17, 1936 the waters reached the flood stage of twenty-five feet.

  ustates.157.d:0 "MacArthur was prepared for extreme action in dealing with both the America First Party and Combined Syndicates. He attacked both parties as being prepared to use the election to destroy the American constitution and thus prepared to pass an act to ban both the parties from participating in the election. The act would remove both the political parties from being legitimate entities and any action that they progressed with would be seen as an act of treason."

  ustates.19.t:0 "MacArthur and Reed"
  ustates.19.d:0 "MacArthur agreed to listen to Reed's requests in an attempt to resolve the dispute but the demands put forth were extreme.

Even some capital ships of our navy have switched allegiance to the Sacramento clique! In order to restore the rule of law, as the saying goes, 'from sea to shining sea', our military leaders have devised a plan for an immediate police action against the rebel PSA to forcibly return those states to the Union. Resistance is expected to be high, however, since many civilians and most of the military are now giving value to their newly-gained independence as a bulwark against the chaos that engulfed the rest of the country. Even on our own home states, the common folk is more interested in returning to their towns and rebuilding their life's than on another round of this fratricidal civil war - if we go ahead with this invasion, we will surelly see a new set of major protests on our cities.
