He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'foremented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Baners' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not betolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
 ita.1.a:0 "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"
 ita.1.b:0 "It would be best if we did not interfere"
 ita.10.t:0 "War with Austria"
 ita.10.d:0 "As we are now in a state of war with Austria, the demilitarised zone of Venice has become obsolete. We must move troops in to protect it at once."
 ita.10.a:0 "I should say so!"
 ita.12.t:0 "A King for Italy"
 ita.12.d:0 "Pope [Root.GetLeader] has decreed that the monarchy in Italy is to be restored. The question remains, however: who shall become king? The two suitable candidates are Amedeo of Savoia-Aosta and Josef von Österreich-Toskana. The House of Savoia-Aosta is the cadet branch of the House of Savoia. Although the main branch was exiled after the Weltkrieg and is generally hated and despised by the population, Amedeo is popular and well-liked. On the other hand, Joseph is not only the Grand Duke of Tuscany and an Archduke of Austria, he is also a valuable military leader."
 ita.12.a:0 "Amedeo of Savoia-Aosta"
 ita.12.b:0 "Josef von Österreich-Toskana"
 ita.13.t:0 "Democratic Elections"
 ita.13.d:0 "Since we now are a democratic country, it is time for free elections! There are four parties at the election: the Italian Popular Party (Partito Popolare Italiano) led by De Gasperi and Gronchi, the Liberal Party (Partito Liberale) lead by Bonomi and Ruini, the Democratic Party (Partito Democratico) led by Orlando and Parri and the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Italiano) led by Secchia and Vassalli.

 ita.15.t:0 "Enemy agitation Over"

 ita.16.t:0 "Territory Integrated"

 ita.17.a:0 "And they shall remain so"
 ita.18.t:0 "Unification?"
 ita.18.d:0 "The northern government has requested the unification of our states under their supremacy. This may be what we were always hoping for, but a deal mostly dictated by them may lead to ruin of all we have been building for years. How do we respond?"
 ita.18.a:0 "Our people deserves to be united (Game over)"
 ita.18.b:0 "We deserve much better deal"
 ita.19.t:0 "Negotiations successful!"
 ita.19.d:0 "Let the Italian people rejoice, for the agreement with Naples has been reached! Italy is whole again! Unfortunately, the agreement has angered many of our nobles, as they fear for their heritage now, that radical socialists are in our government."
 ita.19.a:0 "Time to look beyond the peninsula"
 ita.20.t:0 "Negotiations failed!"
 ita.20.d:0 "Naples has refused our offer, citing our conditions to be unfavourable."
 ita.20.a:0 "One day, Italy will be whole, but not today... not today..."

 ita.26.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties with our nation."

 ita.27.a:0 "That's it? Nothing else?"
 ita.28.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
 ita.28.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries.

 ita.29.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
 ita.29.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries. He returns to Italy having won the return of lands in Venetia and assurances of support from Austria."

 ita.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits [Root.GetName]!"
 ita.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depth, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached [Root.GetName]. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Italian lira is losing value, and industrial exports are shrinking..."
 ita.30.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
 ita.31.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes"
 ita.31.d:0 "The order has been given to clear the Pontine Marshes and thus open the once-useless land for farming or industry. The plan will require the employment of thousands of Italians and take many months to get the bulk of it done, but the outcome may be worth it."
 ita.31.a:0 "So long as it keeps them working, I'm happy"
 ita.32.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes are Cleared"
 ita.32.d:0 "The areas formerly known as the Pontine Marshes are now cleared, with factories and farms springing up throughout the area. More importantly is the hope this brings to the nation, that the malaise hanging over [Root.GetName] by the effects of Black Monday might one day actually come to an end."
 ita.32.a:0 "A monumental achievement!"
 ita.33.t:0 "Worsening Economic Conditions"
 ita.33.d:0 "The economic fallout from Black Monday is getting worse day by day, as we underestimated its initial effects and took limited action to counter them. There are some laissez faire economists who argue that nothing should be done and that the market will recover itself eventually. There are others among the Church who advocate a continuation of a campaign started by Pius XI for the creation of Catholic corporations: they would be structured, organized and controlled with our support, and lead to the creation of many new independent unions that support workers. Some believe that will give rise to more syndicalist sentiment, however."
 ita.33.a:0 "Support and organize the Catholic Corporations"
 ita.33.b:0 "Put more people to work, no matter the cost"

 ita.35.t:0 "Stage 1"
 ita.35.d:0 "The first part of the National development program consists of government making use of the most modern, even experimental techniques for the construction. This will help us in the future."
 ita.35.a:0 "Let the work begin!"
 ita.36.t:0 "Stage 2"
 ita.36.d:0 "The second part of the National development program includes construction of the so called 'Culture houses'. They will function as a way to boost the national pride of our people. The construction itself is bound to make the people content with the government."
 ita.36.a:0 "Let´s continue!"
 ita.37.t:0 "Stage 3"
 ita.37.d:0 "The third part of the National development program has technically been going on since the programs initiation, but now that the rest of the work is done, the progress can accelerate. This part consists of various efforts of land clearance, such as the clearance of Pontine marshes. This will enable us to improve our long-term industrial potential."
 ita.37.a:0 "Yes, do it!"
 ita.38.t:0 "National Construction Program Finished"
 ita.38.d:0 "The program has been a great success! Not only the population likes the results, but, perhaps even more importantly, the government does. Now, it is time to put our effort elsewhere."
 ita.38.a:0 "Great job, guys!"
 ita.40.t:0 "The Death of Pius XI"
 ita.40.d:0 "Earlier today His Holiness Pope Pius XI passed away to the Afterlife.

Until the next pope is chosen, the College of Cardinals will jointly rule over Italy."
 ita.40.a:0 "All Christendom mourns the death of His Holiness"
 ita.41.t:0 "The Death of Pius XI"
 ita.41.d:0 "With the passing of the Pope, what action should we take? Mourn the Pope's death or attempt to install the loyal Duke Giuseppe di Toscana on the throne? Doing so would make [From.GetName] a puppet of Austria, though it would greatly displease the many Catholics of our nation."
 ita.41.a:0 "Send our Condolences to Rome"
 ita.41.b:0 "Press the claims of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana"
 ita.42.t:0 "Austria Interferes!"
 ita.42.d:0 "[From.GetName] is insisting on the installation of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana as King of Italy, interfering with the Papal Election."
 ita.42.a:0 "An emergency conclave elects Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"
 ita.42.b:0 "Elect Giuseppe, we are an Austrian dominion once again"
 ita.42.c:0 "Innitzer will crown Giuseppe, but we shall remain independent"
 ita.43.t:0 "The Papacy Under Innitzer Resists!"
 ita.43.d:0 "The Papacy has defied the prospect of our noble rule, and Cardinal Innitzer has convened an emergency conclave to have himself declared Pope Julius IV. What course of action shall we take now?"
 ita.43.a:0 "If they won't give their independence, we shall take it! To war!"
 ita.43.b:0 "Italy is not worth the trouble, back down"
 ita.43.c:0 "Beg the Papacy for forgiveness!"
 ita.44.t:0 "Austria Backs Down"
 ita.44.d:0 "Though we've watched the border for signs of Austrian aggression, there appears to be none. [From.GetLeader] has apparently backed away from his threat."
 ita.44.a:0 "Did they think they could bully us so easily?"
 ita.45.t:0 "Austria Apologizes"
 ita.45.d:0 "Though we were ready for an invasion, what has occurred is quite the opposite. An envoy from [From.GetNameDef] has expressed apologies from [From.GetLeader] to His Holiness for any offense, and states he will fight to protect our independence in the years to come."
 ita.45.a:0 "Well that was unexpected..."
 ita.46.t:0 "Italy Submits!"
 ita.46.d:0 "Italy caved in to the Austrian Empire as expected, and now Duke Giuseppe sits on the Italian throne as Giuseppe I, a puppet under our benevolent rule."
 ita.46.a:0 "Hurrah!"
 ita.46.b:0 "Great news, in exchange we will return Venetia!"
 ita.47.t:0 "Innitzer Proclaims Giuseppe as King!"
 ita.47.d:0 "Duke Giuseppe has been proclaimed king, as per our demand, but Cardinal Innitzer has engineered a means to retain control over the government. Thus Italy will not be under our control, regardless of the king's true wishes."
 ita.47.a:0 "We endorse this result whole-heartedly!"
 ita.47.b:0 "Very well, but we shall keep our distance"
 ita.47.c:0 "Demand Innitzer step down immediately!"
 ita.48.t:0 "Austia Supports Italian Kingdom"
 ita.48.d:0 "As Duke Giuseppe ascends to the Italian throne, Austria has sent word that they support our kingdom whole-heartedly and have offered to protect our future independence."
 ita.48.a:0 "Wonderful news!"
 ita.49.t:0 "Giuseppe Takes the Throne"
 ita.49.d:0 "While our government worried that Austria's true plan was to take control of Italy through King Giuseppe, they have remained silent on the matter of our continued independence. [From.GetLeader] declined to attend the king'd coronation, and there has been no further contact."
 ita.49.a:0 "No news is good news, right?"
 ita.50.t:0 "Austria Wants Innitzer Gone!"
 ita.50.d:0 "While Austria is apparently pleased with the crowning of Josef, they have shown their true colors by demanding Innitzer step down from the Papacy and for Cardinal Elia Dalla Costa to replace him!"

 ita.50.b:0 "As our new overlords wish..."
 ita.55.t:0 "The Papal Conclave"

 ita.55.c:0 "...elect the socialist cardinal, Achille Liènart, as John XXIII"
 ita.55.e:0 "...elect the hardline Theodor Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"
 ita.56.t:0 "Condemn Pope [From.GetLeader]?"
 ita.56.d:0 "A conclave has elected Pope [From.GetLeader] as the head of the Catholic Church, and thus the ruler of northern Italy. We should condemn him as a potential danger to our nation, but the majority of our people are Catholic and might be upset. Even so, should we stand by and watch our own brethren be brainwashed into such unjust rule?"
 ita.56.a:0 "Religion is - always had been - the enemy of the Proletariat"
 ita.56.b:0 "No, Pope [From.GetLeader] is a socialist and friend of the Republic"
 ita.56.c:0 "Maybe we can come to terms with this new Pope?"
 ita.57.t:0 "The Commune Condemns the Pope"
 ita.57.d:0 "Reacting to the recent ascension of Pope [Root.GetLeader], the Syndicalist Italian Commune in the south has condemned the Holy Father and the Church in a public speech. We must react to this insult."

 ita.58.t:0 "Papal Encyclical Against Syndicalism"
 ita.58.d:0 "Pope [From.GetLeader] has issued an outrageous encyclical condemning Syndicalism, and as a result our mainly Catholic population is growing increasingly restless..."
 ita.58.a:0 "Confiscate church property!"
 ita.58.b:0 "Let this go no further"
