### Leader Descriptions ###
POLITICS_CARLOS_ALBERTO_BRENES_DESC:0 "Carlos Alberto Brenes, a former ally of Guardia Nacional leader, Anastasio Somoza García, assumed the presidency following a compromise between American-backed agricultural interests and the Guardia. While he maintains some degree of independence from the Guardia Nacional, he is both unwilling and unable to curtail its pervasive political influence."
POLITICS_JUAN_BAUTISTA_SACASA_DESC:0 "Juan Bautista Sacasa is the new reformist president of the United Provinces. His Partido Liberal oppose the corruption and political violence so common under the Guardia Nacional controlled regimes of the past. With Sacasa's election, the United Provinces will almost certainly become a more free and democratic nation."
POLITICS_REAL_SOMOZA_DESC:0 "Anastasio Somoza García is the leader of the infamous Guardia Nacional and now president of the United Provinces. His authoritarian regime is widely accused of extra-judicial killings and fraud, and opposition elements in the United Provinces remain constantly guarded for fear of crackdowns and Guardia infiltration."
POLITICS_ANASTASIO_SOMOZA_GARCIA_DESC:0 "Jorge Ubico Castañeda, an anti-socialist émigré from Centroamérica, is the new president of the United Provinces. His rule is absolute, the state and his personality cult infiltrate all facets of civilian life. Suspected Socialists face torture, public humiliation, and execution at the hands of his regime."

### Events ###
united.1.t:0 "Panamá Disease is Killing the Banana Crop"
united.1.d:0 "The United Provinces, the leading exporter of bananas, has been struck by what many are calling: 'Panamá Disease'. This affliction is caused by a fungus which attacks the roots of the banana plant. Our nation relies greatly on banana exports, and without them our entire economy is in jeopardy. Severe economic turmoil will almost certainly increase our vulnerability to socialist fifth-columnists, and perhaps even war with Centroamérica. We must stop this outbreak before our streets are littered not only with rotten bananas, but with blood. We can mandate the cultivation of alternative crops, use more fungicide, develop new cultivars, or import other species of the banana."
united.1.a:0 "Order the farmers to grow new crops!"
united.1.b:0 "Fungicide will kill this disease"
united.1.c:0 "Develop new cultivars that are immune to the fungus"
united.2.t:0 "The New Economy of The United Provinces"
united.2.d:0 "After the outbreak of the Panamá disease, we mandated farmers to cultivate new crops. The transition will be slow and difficult, but Panamá Disease seems to be an unsolvable problem."
united.2.a:0 "It won't be easy, but the United Provinces will endure!"
united.3.t:0 "The Panamá Disease is Immune to Fungicide"
united.3.d:0 "Following the outbreak of Panamá Disease, we increased fungicide usage. Our decision seems to have backfired, however. Not only have fungicides proven ineffective in combating Panamá Disease, but many farmers have lost faith in our government."
united.3.a:0 "Save the banana, costs be damned."
united.3.b:0 "Order farmers to grow other crops."
united.4.t:0 "The New Cultivars aren't Immune"
united.4.d:0 "After the outbreak of the Panamá Disease, we attempted to develop cultivars immune to the fungus, but they too have been afflicted."
united.4.a:0 "Save the banana, costs be damned."
united.4.b:0 "Order farmers to grow other crops!"
united.5.t:0 "Centroamérica Funds Dissidents"
united.5.d:0 "Centroamérica have begun funding socialist rebels in Honduras. In hushed tones, people there whisper of revolution, and our control over the region has begun to erode."
united.5.a:0 "This will not be the first left-wing uprising we have crushed!"
united.6.t:0 "Centroamérica Seizes San Pedro Sula!"
united.6.d:0 "Socialist Centroamérica and their Honduran insurrectionists have launched a successful attack against our administration in San Pedro Sula. Northern Honduras is now under socialist control. Shall we declare war, or back down?"
united.6.a:0 "Declare war!"
united.6.b:0 "Back down."
united.7.t:0 "Centroamérica Attacks San Pedro Sula!"
united.7.d:0 "The foolish Centroaméricans have attempted to seize control of northern Honduras. Our brave soldiers repelled their attack and leftist dissidents in the region have been exposed. For now at least, our position in Honduras is secure. Centroamérica, however, is sure to distort this incident for their own benefit. War with Centroamérica may be imminent."
united.7.a:0 "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst."
united.8.t:0 "Centroamérica Declares War!"
united.8.d:0 "Centroamérica has predictably twisted their failed attack to justify war. The final struggle for the future of Central America is upon us."
united.8.a:0 "To War!"
united.9.t:0 "The Government of Panamá Collapses"
united.9.d:0 "Following the assassination of its President, Panamá erupted in violence between leftist guerrillas and government forces. We must secure Panamá before the chaos spreads across our borders! The United States, in a bid to curtial the spread of socialism in Central America, have promised us their support."
united.9.a:0 "Occupy Panamá; We must bring an end to the chaos"
united.9.b:0 "We mustn't interfere"
united.10.t:0 "Panamá Joins the United Provinces"
united.10.d:0 "Rather than fall to socialism, Panamá has decided to join the United Provinces."
united.10.a:0 "Excellent"
united.11.t:0 "Choosing a Partner"
united.11.d:0 "We have an abundance of exports, but due to the measures we took to combat Panamá Disease, much of our country is a shade of what it was before the blight. We must seek aid from a foreign power in exchange for more favorable trade regulations."
united.11.a:0 "Reach out to Europe"
united.11.b:0 "Investigate American markets"
united.12.t:0 "Offer from the United Provinces"
united.12.d:0 "The United Provinces of Central America has offered to reduce restrictions on our trade in exchange for development aid. We already have considerable influence in the United Provinces, and if we accept this deal, our influence is sure to grow further. Such a deal may also offer our citizens the reprieve of material luxuries in these troubled times."
united.12.a:0 "Accept their deal"
united.12.b:0 "Decline, we cannot afford it"
united.13.t:0 "Offer from the United Provinces"
united.13.d:0 "The United Provinces of Central America has offered to reduce restrictions on our trade in exchange for development aid. We already have considerable influence in the United Provinces, and if we accept this deal, our influence is sure to grow further. Such a deal may also offer our citizens the reprieve of material luxuries in these troubled times."

united.14.t:0 "Offer from the United Provinces"
united.14.d:0 "The United Provinces of Central America has offered to reduce restrictions on our trade in exchange for development aid. We already have considerable influence in the United Provinces, and if we accept this deal, our influence is sure to grow further. Such a deal may also offer our citizens the reprieve of material luxuries in these troubled times."
united.14.a:0 "Accept their deal"
united.14.b:0 "Decline, we cannot afford it"
united.15.t:0 "Germany Accepts"
united.15.d:0 "The German Empire has accepted our offer of reduced regulation in exchange for aid."

united.16.t:0 "Canada Accepts"
united.16.d:0 "The Dominion of Canada has accepted our offer of reduced regulation in exchange for aid."
united.16.a:0 "Great!"
united.17.t:0 "The United States Accepts"
united.17.d:0 "The United States has accepted our offer of reduced regulation in exchange for aid."
united.17.a:0 "Great!"
united.18.t:0 "Dealing with the President"
united.18.d:0 "Our President, Carlos Alberto Brenes, has, since his appointment in 1935, struggled to maintain independence from the Guardia. With American influence waning, his grip on power has become increasingly weak. It is time for a stronger president, Anastasio Somoza García, head of the Guardia."
united.18.a:0 "All hail the new Presidente!"
united.19.t:0 "Guardia Rule"
united.19.d:0 "President, Anastasio Somoza García has cemented his rule, and his Guardia Nacional have increasingly become incorporated into the state apparatus. In order to assure loyalty and unity, President Somoza has ordered the resignation of all civil servants without membership in the Guardia Nacional. The Guardia will assume those positions vacated."
united.19.a:0 "Viva Guardia!"
united.20.t:0 "Elections"
united.20.d:0 "President, Anastasio Somoza García has, surprisingly, agreed to hold new elections as planned. Two candidates have risen to prominence, Juan Bautista Sacasa, of the Partido Liberal and Jorge Ubico, a Centroamérican exile who leads the anti-socialist Coalición Nacional."
united.20.a:0 "Victory for the Coalición Nacional"
united.20.b:0 "Victory for the Partido Liberal"

### Focuses ###
NIC_Panama_Disease:0 "Panamá Disease"
NIC_Panama_Disease_desc:0 "Our bananas are wilting, and with them, our nation. If something is not done about this devastating blight, the United Provinces too shall perish."
NIC_New_Crops:0 "New Crops"
NIC_New_Crops_desc:0 "The timely end of the current epidemic of Panamá Disease cannot be guaranteed. It is essential that our economy be completely reoriented, and quickly; we must replace the banana."
NIC_Keep_Banana:0 "Keep The Banana"
NIC_Keep_Banana_desc:0 "Without the banana, our nation will surely crumble. We must overcome Panamá Disease, and preserve our banana industry."
NIC_Reserves:0 "Build Up Reserves"
NIC_Reserves_desc:0 "While the blight has greatly increased the price of bananas internationally, our export volume fluctuates greatly with even miniscule changes in the spread of Panamá Disease. In order to reduce illegal speculation and ensure a modicum of stability, we should require banana growers to withhold a percentage of their healthy produce from the market, to be sent to a national banana reserve."
NIC_Cavendish:0 "Import Cavendish Bananas"
NIC_Cavendish_desc:0 "While initial efforts to introduce new banana cultivars largely failed, one in particular has proven immune to Panamá Disease: the Cavendish. We should replace our current bananas with the Cavendish."
NIC_Exports_For_Aid:0 "Exports For Aid"
NIC_Exports_For_Aid_desc:0 "While Panamá Disease is no longer the harbinger of doom it once was, our country has been devastated. In order to facilitate the reconstruction of the most heavily affect areas of our nation, we require foreign aid. Whichever nation we petition will surely gain substantial influence in our country."
NIC_Ger:0 "German Aid"
NIC_Ger_desc:0 "Germany is already heavily invested in our coffee industry, and while they may be amenable to our offer, their influence over us will likely become increasingly dominant."
NIC_Can:0 "Canadian Aid"
NIC_Can_desc:0 "Canada is staunchly opposed to socialism, and our role as a bulwark against leftism in Latin America may prove advantageous to reaching a mutually agreeable aid deal."
NIC_Usa:0 "American Aid"
NIC_Usa_desc:0 "The United States sees itself as the protector of the Americas from foreign coercion. They may be willing to work with us simply to reduce German influence in our nation."
NIC_Coffee:0 "Grow Coffee"
NIC_Coffee_desc:0 "While bananas are our largest export, we also produce a sizeable quantity of coffee beans. We should encourage banana growers to switch to coffee beans, and dominate the coffee industry. This could, however, lead to increased German influence in our country."
NIC_Cows:0 "Encourage Livestock"
NIC_Cows_desc:0 "Nations, such as, La Plata, have achieved prosperity through the production of meat and dairy. To halt our economic decline, we should encourage animal husbandry and the cultivation of grains for animal feed."
NIC_Force_Farmers:0 "Force Farmers To Switch"
NIC_Force_Farmers_desc:0 "Despite our encouragement of a transition away from banana cultivation, many farmers defiantly maintain bananas, even in the face of Panamá Disease. They must be made to switch production."
NIC_Coffee_Republic:0 "Coffee Republic"
NIC_Coffee_Republic_desc:0 "The nations of Central America have long been disbaragingly referred to as 'Banana Republics', for their singular reliance on banana exports. With our increased reliance on coffee, many now label us a 'Coffee Republic'."
NIC_Meat_Industry:0 "Meat Industry"
NIC_Meat_Industry_desc:0 "Livestock counts in the fields of the United Provinces have skyrocketed, but the only facilities in our nation which can process large quantities of meat, produce military rations. Rather than sell these facilities or retool them, we can export rations."
NIC_Import_Substition:0 "Import Substitution"
NIC_Import_Substition_desc:0 "Panamá Disease exposed the vulnerability of our commodity based economic system. We should subsidise industry and place tariffs on goods which can be easily produced domestically."
NIC_Feed_Our_People:0 "Feed Our People"
NIC_Feed_Our_People_desc:0 "While ration exports have so-far been an effective replacement for the banana, many of our people have no more access to basic nourishment than they did before the onset of Panamá disease. We should reserve a portion of every batch of rations for distribution to the poorest among us."
NIC_Full_Recovery:0 "Full Recovery"
NIC_Full_Recovery_desc:0 "Life in our country has returned to a semblance of normalcy, though in truth, Panamá Disease has irreversibly changed the United Provinces. With this crisis behind us, our nation can now look outwards."
NIC_Foreign_Investment:0 "Attract Foreign Investment"
NIC_Foreign_Investment_desc:0 "With the crisis came a marked reduction of the inflow of foreign capital. With the blight at an end, perhaps we can incentivise the return of foreign investment to our nation."
NIC_Strenghen_Exports:0 "Strengthen Exports"
NIC_Strenghen_Exports_desc:0 "Many foreign nations have reacted to recent economic hardships by enacting high tariffs. We must lobby foreign governments to reduce tariffs on our goods."
NIC_Unite_The_Nation:0 "Unite the Nation"
NIC_Unite_The_Nation_desc:0 "Several factions vie for power, often clashing violently. We must establish, at least temporarily, order sufficient to effectuate our coming elections."
NIC_Deal_With_The_President:0 "Deal With The President"
NIC_Deal_With_The_President_desc:0 "Originally appointed in a compromise between the Americans and Guardia, President Carlos Alberto Brenes, himself a former member of the Guardia, has become increasingly supplanted by Guardia boss Somoza. Somoza is likely to assume the Presidency before the next elections."
NIC_Elections:0 "Hold Elections"
NIC_Elections_desc:0 "President Somoza shall allow the elections to procede as planned. The Guardia will almost certainly be rejected by voters, but their influence will continue to be felt."
NIC_Liberal:0 "Liberal Government"
NIC_Liberal_desc:0 "The Partido Liberal advocates for increased democratisation, and a more open political sphere. Their leader, Juan Bautista Sacasa, has vowed to combat the influence of the Guardia Nacional."
NIC_Encourage_Free_Thought:0 "Encourage Free Thought"
NIC_Encourage_Free_Thought_desc:0 "While citizens of the United Provinces and the prior nations of Costa Rica, and Nicaragua, once enjoyed protections on freedom of expression, the threat of socialism caused the gradual restriction of individual rights. The new Liberal has vowed to restore those rights, arguing that it is precisely freedom of expression which best combats leftist agitation."
NIC_Improve_Conditions:0 "Improve Conditions"
NIC_Improve_Conditions_desc:0 "The poor of our nation have live in filth and squalor, and toil without restriction. By protecting the destitute, we can both allow all to enjoy basic human dignity, and curtail the spread of radical ideologies."
NIC_Defense_Forces:0 "Provincial Defence Forces"
NIC_Defense_Forces_desc:0 "The Guardia Nacional have terrorised the United Provinces for long enough. With support for our reforms high, we can now restructure the Guardia into a reserve military force with proper governmental oversight."
NIC_Write_Constitution:0 "New Constitution"
NIC_Write_Constitution_desc:0 "The current constitution has proven unable to protect our nation from tyranny. We must write a framework able to maintain governmental structure and preserve liberty, even in times of hardship."
NIC_Ubico:0 "Ubico's Provinces"
NIC_Ubico_desc:0 "Ubico Jorge Casteñeda fled Centroamérica following the socialist revolution. He is a vocal proponent of hardline anti-socialism, and has achieved vehement support in areas most affected by leftist political violence. Victory for Ubico's Coalición Nacional would likely precipitate the end of democracy in the United Provinces."
NIC_New_Guardia:0 "Nuevo Guardia"
NIC_New_Guardia_desc:0 "President Ubico, while opposed to the corruption and thuggishness pervasive in the Guardia Nacional, sees value in the organisation. By compromizing with certain Guardia leaders and purging the rest, Ubico plans to take control of the Guardia, and refashion it as the paramilitary wing of the Coalición Nacional."
NIC_Spy_Network:0 "Establish Spy Network"
NIC_Spy_Network_desc:0 "The threat of socialism looms ominously over our country. The populace must be free of this omnipresent gheist! President Ubico has drafted a provisional framework for a domestic intelligence organisation responsible for the suppression of internal dissent and leftist ideology."
NIC_Anti_Corruption:0 "No Tolerance For Corruption"
NIC_Anti_Corruption_desc:0 "Corruption has become systemic within our government. While most corruption was linked with the old Guardia Nacional, it remains a major challenge for Presidential authority. President Ubico plans to deploy spies and paramilitary units to extra-legally terrorise officials accused of corruption."
NIC_Ally_United_Fruit:0 "Ally With United Fruit"
NIC_Ally_United_Fruit_desc:0 "The American 'United Fruit Company' was responsible for the establishment of many of our banana plantations. It still retains control over much of the economy. We should assure good relations between United Fruit and our administration."
NIC_Military:0 "Guardia Control"
NIC_Military_desc:0 "Under the pretence of 'safeguarding' our nation from socialist subversion, President Somoza has cancelled our scheduled elections. It appears that the Guardia Nacional are now fully in control of our government."
NIC_Destroy_The_Socialists:0 "Destroy The Socialists"
NIC_Destroy_The_Socialists_desc:0 "Despite suppression, socialism continues to be a dangerous fifth-column in our society. In order to assure the preservation of our government, and perhaps even our nation, socialism must be destroyed by any means necessary."
NIC_Propoganda_Towers:0 "Propaganda Towers"
NIC_Propoganda_Towers_desc:0 "The people are distrustful of the Guardia Nacional and President Somoza. In response, Somoza has authorised new restrictions on media organisations, and the construction of a new network of radio towers for the exclusive usage of state-owned stations."
NIC_Foreign_Experts:0 "Foreign Experts"
NIC_Foreign_Experts_desc:0 "As long as our nation lacks industry, we may lack the supplies necessary to repulse Centroamérican invasion. President Somoza has proposed hiring foreign experts to supervise the expansion of our industry."
NIC_Empower_Guardia:0 "Expand The Guardia"
NIC_Empower_Guardia_desc:0 "Our military is inefficient, and our generals conspire against the regime. We should integrate the Guardia Nacional into our military to ensure loyalty and effectiveness."
NIC_Encourage_Company_Infastructure:0 "Encourage Company Infrastructure"
NIC_Encourage_Company_Infastructure_desc:0 "Foreign companies, to facilitate the banana trade, have been responsible for the construction of most of our infrastructure. We can incentivise those same companies to build railways throughout our nation."
NIC_Fund_Uni:0 "Fund Universities"
NIC_Fund_Uni_desc:0 "With our political environment stabilised, the United Provinces looks to the future. Higher educational opportunities in our nation are nearly non-existent, and as a result we have fallen behind our neighbours technologically; We must construct new universities."
NIC_Military_Reforms:0 "Military Reforms"
NIC_Military_Reforms_desc:0 "Our military lacks nearly everything which constitutes an effective fighting force. To ensure at least some degree of national security, we must completely reinvent our armed forces."
NIC_Armament_Effort:0 "Armament Effort"
NIC_Armament_Effort_desc:0 "While we previously obtained surplus armaments from the Weltkrieg, these weapons have become increasingly obsolete, and fallen into disrepair. We must establish facilities capable of repairing and retrofitting military equipment."
NIC_Development_Effort:0 "Development Effort"
NIC_Development_Effort_desc:0 "While updating old equipment is of great importance, equally necessary is the development and acquisition of new weapons systems - something we have neglected over a decade. We must focus on the adoption of new small-arms."
NIC_Officer_Schools:0 "Officer Schools"
NIC_Officer_Schools_desc:0 "Our officers lack both competence and experience. We must construct new military academies and disrupt the nepotism prevalent in our officership."
NIC_Modernise_Tactics:0 "Modernise Tactics"
NIC_Modernise_Tactics_desc:0 "Our army lacks central direction and various generals vie for power within it. To curtail this uncertainty and constant in-fighting, our army must have a unified doctrine."
NIC_Fortification_Effort:0 "Fortification Effort"
NIC_Fortification_Effort_desc:0 "Our border with Centroamérica is largely porous; socialist insurrectionists smuggle arms and other supplies across the border with ease. To curtail smuggling and hopefully prevent Centroamérican invasion, we should clear the jungle along the border and construct a series of fortifications."
NIC_Recruitment_Effort:0 "Recruitment Effort"
NIC_Recruitment_Effort_desc:0 "The United Provinces has given rise to a plethora of militias and paramilitaries, most prominently, the Guardia Nacional. We should adapt the recruitment strategies of these organisations for our military."
NIC_Military_Science:0 "Military Science"

NIC_Build_Shipyard:0 "Build Shipyard"

NIC_Submarine_Effort:0 "U-Boat Effort"
NIC_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "Without the U-Boat, Germany may have lost the Weltkrieg. If our new navy is to be effective, it must have U-Boats."
NIC_Submarine_Doctrine:0 "U-Boat Doctrine"
NIC_Submarine_Doctrine_desc:0 "Our inexperience with U-Boats greatly reduces their effectiveness. We should study German U-Boat doctrine and adapt it for our own situation."
NIC_Destroyer:0 "Destroyer Effort"
NIC_Destroyer_desc:0 "With wartime trade increasingly under threat from U-Boat attacks, destroyers, are becoming increasingly important to the protection of trade. If our merchant ships are to remain afloat, we must have destroyers to protect them."
NIC_Cruiser:0 "Cruiser Effort"
NIC_Cruiser_desc:0 "Destroyers alone are vulnerable to attacks from surface fleets and aircraft, cruisers offer better protection from both, and afford our navy increased power projection."
NIC_Doctrine:0 "Naval Doctrine"

NIC_aviation_effort:0 "Aviation Effort"
NIC_aviation_effort_desc:0 "Aircraft entered the battlefields of the Weltkrieg untested and emerged dominant. Our armed forces tragically lacks sufficient numbers of aircraft and the airbases to field them. We must construct airbases and begin the formation of our air force."

NIC_bomber_focus:0 "Bomber Focus"
NIC_bomber_focus_desc:0 "Bombers devastate the enemy's industrial infrastructure and wreak havoc on their populace. Our country is mostly agrarian and lacks the industry to sustain a long war. We therefore must be able to mitigate an enemy's industrial advantage."
