 sprd.1.t: "State of the Kingdom"
 sprd.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898, only her few African holdings staying intact. After this, seperatist movements in both the Basque country and Catalonia arose, and continue to gain traction to this very day. As if that was not enough, both the Church and a radical worker's movement, the C.N.T., are interfering in her internal politics, and have driven a great ideological divide into her populace. \n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII showed expansionist tendencies in the Spanish intervention in Morocco, finally establishing a protectorate over the North and South of the country in 1912, but these lands became a source of permanent unrest. \n\nWhile Spain remained neutral throughout the Weltkrieg, 1918 saw a number of revolts by followers of both right-wing and leftist ideologies. In 1923, Alfonso XIII supported a military coup against the government by General Miguel Primo de Rivera, who abolished the constitution of 1876 and installed a dictatorial rule between 1923 and 1930. He ended the uprising in Morocco with a victory over Abd el-Krim in 1926, but could not master the economic crisis and had to resign after repeated revolts by the military and students. His position was taken over by José María Gil-Robles Quiñones, a moderate right-wing politician, in 1930. \n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist C.N.T.-F.A.I., inspired by the uprisings in both France and Britain, seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntarist federation of communes and economic collectives. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
 sprd.1.a: "Plus Ultra!"
 
 
 sprd.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Spain"
 sprd.2.d:0 "The Spanish economy has been tied to Germany since the end of the Weltkrieg. Since France and England's defeat, a good portion of our economy has been centred around exporting materials and goods to the German markets. As such, we can expect a flood of layoffs and closings. Our political foes will undoubtedly use this to their advantage."
 sprd.2.a:0 "We did not need this!"
 
 
 sprd.3.t:0 "Breakdown of our Society"
 sprd.3.d:0 "The bickering of both leftist and traditionalist fanatics have been driving the Spanish people into a frenzy, and is slowly tearing this country apart. Daily protests and violence across the country leaves little hope for continued peace."
 sprd.3.a:0 "This is not going to end well."
 
 ### carlist chain
 
 sprd.4.t:0 "Alfonso Carlos de Borbón dies"
 sprd.4.d:0 "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 86. He died a natural death, so his passing should have put an end to the problem of Carlist succession, as the current King, Alfonso XIII, is now the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the head of the Carlist community in Spain, Duke Javier de Borbón-Parma, was designated instead by the Duke as his rightful heir."
 sprd.4.a:0 "The Carlists must be plotting something."
 
 sprd.5.t:0 "Javier's Speech"

 sprd.5.a:0 "While his efforts are admirable, he is still a threat. Keep him under surveillance."
 
 sprd.6.t:0 "Portugal agrees to join Javier's Bloc"
 sprd.6.d:0 "Portugal has agreed to Javier's proposed Mediterranean Economic Bloc. While this will help the recovery of our economy, it helps the areas that Javier holds sway over the most."
 sprd.6.a:0 "Any help is better than no help"
 
 sprd.7.t:0 "Italian Federation agrees to join Javier's Bloc"
 sprd.7.d:0 "The Italian Federation has agreed to Javier's proposed Mediterranean Economic Bloc. While this will help the recovery of our economy, it helps the areas that Javier holds sway over the most."
 sprd.7.a:0 "Any help is better than no help"
 
 sprd.8.t:0 "Javier's Ambitions to the Throne"
 sprd.8.d:0 "Following his recent diplomatic successes abroad, Carlist leader Javier has given another speech. He uses his successes to claim himself more suited to run this country than King Alfonso."
