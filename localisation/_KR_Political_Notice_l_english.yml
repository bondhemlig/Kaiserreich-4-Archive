#kr.political.27.d:0 "Do I need Waking the Tiger? What about Death or Dishonour? Will the universe end in vacuum decay?\n\nNo, you do not need Waking the Tiger or any other DLC to play Kaiserreich Alpha 0.6 - 'Garibaldi's Nightmare', though yes the universe will end in vacuum decay.\n\nWe have been thinking and talking a lot about DLC within the team and what our policy should be surrounding it. We have not yet reached a conclusion and thus we may change things for 0.7, we may not. But until then, enjoy Kaiserreich with all, some or no DLC. That being said, if you do have DLC by all means use it and enjoy those shiny unit models and associated features!\n\nPlease also note that work with 1.5 'Cornflakes' is no where near done, so many nations are not yet fully making use of stability, decisions etc. This is something we will be working on for next patch."

kr.political.27.t:0 "We're Changing Home!"
kr.political.27.d:0 "Starting with 0.8, next major patch, we will be moving to a new steam workshop location. When 0.8 goes live the old steam workshop location will be replaced with a dud version of the mod which simply points to the new location.\n\nWhy are we doing this? The old version of the mod was uploaded using the personal account of a modder and steam only lets the original author update. To avoid any issues in the future we have created a team account so that we aren't dependant on any one person. We have already moved the music mod to it as a test. We are sorry about the trouble but feel this is best to prevent problems in the future."
