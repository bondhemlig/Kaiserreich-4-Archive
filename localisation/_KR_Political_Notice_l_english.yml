#kr.political.27.d:0 "Do I need Waking the Tiger? What about Death or Dishonour? Will the universe end in vacuum decay?\n\nNo, you do not need Waking the Tiger or any other DLC to play Kaiserreich Alpha 0.6 - 'Garibaldi's Nightmare', though yes the universe will end in vacuum decay.\n\nWe have been thinking and talking a lot about DLC within the team and what our policy should be surrounding it. We have not yet reached a conclusion and thus we may change things for 0.7, we may not. But until then, enjoy Kaiserreich with all, some or no DLC. That being said, if you do have DLC by all means use it and enjoy those shiny unit models and associated features!\n\nPlease also note that work with 1.5 'Cornflakes' is no where near done, so many nations are not yet fully making use of stability, decisions etc. This is something we will be working on for next patch."
#kr.political.27.a:0 "Thanks for all the info, but can I please play now?"

kr.political.27.t:0 "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!"
kr.political.27.d:0 "We hope you enjoy your holidays and get some well deserved rest, be that playing our favourite video game or otherwise.\n\nTo our nearly 500,000 players, we would like to thank each and every one of you for playing and enjoying our work. It has been an amazing year and we have come so far; this time last year the Italian rework hadn't even been released, let alone the multitude of content that has followed it. We have plenty planned for 2019 and plan to make it even bigger and better than the years before it, we hope you'll stick around.\n\nHere's to another fantastic year of Kaiserreich!"
kr.political.27.a:0 "To another year!"
