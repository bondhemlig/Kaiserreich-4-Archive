### Events ###
balticduchy.1.t:0 "The United Baltic Duchy"
balticduchy.1.d:0 "Der ostliche Schutzwall des Kaiserreichs, is how the United Baltic Duchy came to be known. In this rather small client state of the German Empire, the full spectrum of political powers is concentrated with the Baltic German minority, who live mainly in the cities of Riga, Revel, and the islands of Osel and Dago. The rest of the country is populated mainly by Latvians and Estonians."
balticduchy.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
balticduchy.1.b:0 ""Yada, yada, just let me play!"

balticduchy.2.t:0 "The Duchy's Interior Situation"
balticduchy.2.d:0 ""Administratively, the Duchy is subdivided into two Stadte, Riga and Revel, and four Länder, which are Oselland, Estland, Livland, and Kurland. As the country is organised along unitarian lines, the regions have only very little power. Moreover, recent tensions with rural Estonian and Latvian populations has prompted the formation of two specialised security commands for Livland and Estland.""
balticduchy.2.a:0 "Just what have I gotten myself into?"

balticduchy.3.t:0 "The Duchy's Overall Situation"
balticduchy.3.d:0 "Overall, the Duchy's position is not entirely enviable. Lithuania wants sea access, Russia wants its Baltic provinces back, Finland has pan-Finno-Ugric ideas. In addition, the lack of strong authority over the Lander of Estland, Livland, and Kurland severely hampers the economy. Outstanding interior problems shall have to be resolved before future plans can be addressed."
balticduchy.3.a:0 "Next game, I'm playing Switzerland."

balticduchy.4.t:0 "A new Imperial State!"
balticduchy.4.d:0 "His Highness Adolf Friedrich the First, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and of the United Baltic Duchy, has requested from the Reichstag and the Deutsche Kaiser the recognition of his Baltic domains as a Constituent State of the German Empire."
balticduchy.4.a:0 "A Triple Hurrah for the German Empire!"

balticduchy.5.t:0 "Promised Election"
balticduchy.5.d:0 "The new parliamentary elections are coming and thanks to our new national election system only two parties were able to make into parliament. The highly xenophobic ' Nationalist German Party' and the 'Conservative Party'. The social democrats, Baltic nationalists, and Liberal democrats were too marginal to have majority."
balticduchy.5.a:0 "Conservative Party"
balticduchy.5.b:0 "Nationalist German Party"

balticduchy.6.t:0 "Birth of Baltic Federation"
balticduchy.6.d:0 "Today, Ducal Government of the United Baltic Duchy have announced, that only together we can survive in this cruel world. Old government have shown their incompetence in ruling our country. Duke Adolf and some other minister have formed a Provisional Government, until the new government will have been elected. Long live the Federation!"
balticduchy.6.a:0 "Unite we stand"

balticduchy.7.t:0 "Federation Election"
balticduchy.7.d:0 "His Highness Adolf Friedrich the First, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and of the United Baltic Duchy, has requested from the Reichstag and the Deutsche Kaiser the recognition of his Baltic domains as a Constituent State of the German Empire."
balticduchy.7.a:0 "Prosperity Party"
balticduchy.7.b:0 "All-Baltic Coalition"
balticduchy.7.c:0 "Conservative Party"

balticduchy.8.t:0 "Left-Wing Radicals seize the power"
balticduchy.8.d:0 "Radicals, sponsored by communard bastards, start an open rebellion agains us. Duke himself and most of his cabinet have been captured. Red flags are waving from top of the Ducal Reichstag. Now it's time to choose, who will lead the comrades of new Baltic Union?"
balticduchy.8.a:0 "Baltic Socialist Party, peaceful reformers"
balticduchy.8.b:0 "United Baltic Syndicates, followers of the Orthodox Syndycalism"
balticduchy.8.c:0 "Baltic Totalist Party seize the power and declare one-party state"

balticduchy.29.t:0 "Baltic Germans and their Duchy"
balticduchy.29.d:0 "As economic stagnation and recession nears, old feuds between largely urban Germans and rural non-Germans gain new strength. Some propose to further encourage Germans to settle the land, others wish to integrate the local population fully into the political life. In the end, the choice is in between fully integrating into the Empire or partially emancipating ourselves from Imperial authority."
balticduchy.29.a:0 "Interesting"

balticduchy.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits the United Baltic Duchy!"
balticduchy.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached the United Baltic Duchy. German-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Papiermark is losing value, and agricultural exports are shrinking..."
balticduchy.30.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."

balticduchy.50.t:0 "Crisis in army!"
balticduchy.50.d:0 "As reforms go on, some generals want to introduce the recruitment of 'natives' or ,speaking the new language, Latvians and Estonians. The Ministry of War agrees that none of them should be able to be more than low-ranking officers."
balticduchy.50.a:0 "Start recruitment"
balticduchy.50.b:0 "No reforms are needed"

balticduchy.51.t:0 "Mutiny of Latvian units"
balticduchy.51.d:0 "As pessimists predicted, mutiny has started in one of the Latvian-speaking units and soon threatened nearly every non-German and non-Estonian unit. The mutineers want more freedom for the ordinary soldier, better food, higher payment, but radicals speak of 'overthrowing the evil German regime'. We can win over a majority of the mutineers, however some negotiations will be needed."
balticduchy.51.a:0 "Start negotiations"
balticduchy.51.b:0 "They don't deserve anything!"

balticduchy.52.t:0 "Rebellion in Kurland"
balticduchy.52.d:0 "The rural population and some city dwellers in Kurland have decided to rise against the German population. Thankfully, the rebellion is limited only to a few provinces and should be easily crushed."
balticduchy.52.a:0 "Crush dissenters!"

balticduchy.53.t:0 "Rebellion in Livland"
balticduchy.53.d:0 "The rural population and some city dwellers in Livland have decided to rise against the German population. Thankfully, the rebellion is limited only to a few provinces and should be easily crushed."
balticduchy.53.a:0 "Crush dissenters!"

balticduchy.54.t:0 "Rebellion in Estland"
balticduchy.54.d:0 "The rural population and some city dwellers in Estland have decided to rise against the German population. Thankfully, the rebellion is limited only to a few provinces and should be easily crushed."
balticduchy.54.a:0 "Crush dissenters!"

balticduchy.70.t:0 "Nationalist movements agitating"
balticduchy.70.d:0 "The decision of our German masters to speed up the integration of the entire region into the German Empire was met with stern disapproval from the native Latvian and Estonian population. To fight against waves of German settlers which are intended to definitely destroy both nations various radical nationalist groups were reactivated.
