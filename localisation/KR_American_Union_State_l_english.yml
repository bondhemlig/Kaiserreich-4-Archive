  unionstate.2.d:0 "With the end of the Civil War, we should decide where our capital will be.  Will it be moved back to Washington?"
  unionstate.2.a:0 "Washington is a corrupt city."
  unionstate.2.b:0 "Washington has been cleansed of the Corruption."
  unionstate.3.t:0 "Rebirth of the Country"
  unionstate.3.d:0 "After the devastation of the American Civil War, Long and the America First Party were hoping to rebuild America stronger than before. The Syndicalist threat was still present around the world and a strong America was needed to meet that threat. Due to the war there was a significant labour shortage and tough decisions would be needed to get the country back on its feet."
  unionstate.3.a:0 "Conscript the labour required"
  unionstate.3.b:0 "The corporations can handle this"
  unionstate.571.t:0 "The American Union State Youth"
  unionstate.571.d:0 "Fritz Kuhn has submitted a plan to start a Youth Foundation in the AUS and is looking for approval. The Foundation would show Adolescents the purpose of America First and to teach them discipline above all things and loyalty to the New State. We're in need of new recruits, and Fritz Kuhn's Youth Foundation may be part of the solution."

  unionstate.4.a:0 "Sign the document."
  unionstate.5.t:0 "American Union War Industry"

  unionstate.7.t:0 "Long and the PSA Leadership"
  unionstate.7.d:0 "After the end of the civil war, the question of the PSA leadership was put before Long. The insolence of the PSA leadership needed to be punished but it could alienate the west coast and cause further problems. If the PSA leadership was removed, the industry of the west coast would be available but the expertise of the pacific industries would be diminished."
  unionstate.7.a:0 "Hang them all"
  unionstate.7.b:0 "Amnesty it is"
  unionstate.8.t:0 "US Government in Exile"
  unionstate.8.d:0 "The victory of America First over the US government has forced them to flee from the country to Canada. The government has vowed to keep on fighting but without a firm power base there is very little chance of making a difference."

  unionstate.9.t:0 "The Beacon of the New America"
  unionstate.9.d:0 "Long wanted to show the world that the old and corrupt America was gone. He chose to make his hometown, New Orleans, the beacon of the new America. The city would undergo a massive transformation, new streets and buildings would make it the most modern city in the Americas and a massive shipyard would make it the hub of trade in the south. The massive shipyard would also be the birthplace of the new US navy which would safeguard America's future. Critics however thought the plan would be too expensive."
  unionstate.9.a:0 "No expense will stop this"
  unionstate.9.b:0 "A pipe dream in the end"
  unionstate.10.t:0 "Share Our Wealth"
  unionstate.10.d:0 "Long's plan was to make every man a king. He would tax those who were holders of excessive wealth and use the money to provide public works projects and social services to all Americans. Extreme members of the party saw this as nothing more than a socialist betrayal and threatened trouble against Long if he proceeded."
  unionstate.10.a:0 "Proceed with the plan."
  unionstate.10.b:0 "We need the extremists"
  unionstate.11.t:0 "The Poll Tax"
  unionstate.11.d:0 "Long wished to abolish the Poll Tax to reduce the racial tensions of the south. His proposal was met with immediate condemnation by the extremists within his party. Kuhn and others denounced Long as trying to destroy the sacred institutions of the South. Long retorted that racist and sacred were two different things and rallied the people against what he saw as an evil institution."
  unionstate.11.a:0 "Abolish the damn thing."
  unionstate.11.b:0 "No. We need to maintain the party."
  unionstate.12.t:0 "Long's Tariff"
  unionstate.12.d:0 "To encourage the expansion of American industry, Long planned on implementing a hefty tariff on imported goods. He was warned that the tariff may be worse for the economy in the end."
  unionstate.12.a:0 "Implement the tariff"
  unionstate.12.b:0 "We can do without this"
  unionstate.13.t:0 "American Union Recession"
  unionstate.13.d:0 "Long's tariff had initially helped build a greater reliance on American industry but it was unsustainable in the long run. The American Union State fell into recession and unemployment began to rise."
  unionstate.13.a:0 "Damn."
  unionstate.14.t:0 "Show Trials"
  unionstate.14.d:0 "American socialism had been defeated and now Long was going to make them pay the price. Socialists, Anarchists, and anyone who had supported the CSA had been subject to prosecution by the American Union State. Minute Men began rounding up members of the left and special tribunals were setup. These were nothing more than show trials that humiliated and lambasted the accused."
  unionstate.14.a:0 "Hang them all!"
  unionstate.14.b:0 "Exile the bastards"
  unionstate.15.t:0 "Political Opposition"
  unionstate.15.d:0 "Once the left wing enemies of the American Union State were purged many of the moderates came under suspicion. Many were unconcerned but some of the more extreme members of the government saw the moderates as being not loyal enough and a quiet opposition within the American Union State. The suggestion was made that anyone who had their loyalty in question should be arrested."
  unionstate.15.a:0 "A harsh but necessary step"
  unionstate.15.b:0 "This is too extreme"
  unionstate.16.t:0 "Extremists Move to Depose Long"
  unionstate.16.d:0 "The rift between Long and Kuhn had been growing since before the Civil War and when Long abolished the Poll Tax, Kuhn moved against him. While in New Orleans, Long's compound was surrounded. He had few men but many of them were willing to die for Long and the American Union State."
  unionstate.16.a:0 "Kuhn fails and is arrested"
  unionstate.16.b:0 "Kuhn succeeds and Long is dead!"
  unionstate.17.t:0 "The Industrial Security Act"
  unionstate.17.d:0 "The Industrial Security Act was Long's answer to the trade unions of the north. The act would make any disruption of essential industries by work stoppages a conspiracy to commit industrial sabotage and would be punishable by imprisonment. The wording on the act was intentionally vague to give the President a highly effective means with which to defeat the unions."
  unionstate.17.a:0 "Pass the act"
  unionstate.17.b:0 "This is too much"
  unionstate.18.t:0 "Industrial Decentralization Act"
  unionstate.18.d:0 "Long had seen the rust belt as being corrupted by the trade unions and socialists. The amount of industry in the rust belt had given the syndicates a large advantage against the former US government and Long wanted to ensure that this did not happen again. A plan was put forward to move the industry from the rust belt into the mid-west and south to defeat the corruption of the Rust Belt and further castrate the trade unions."
  unionstate.18.a:0 "Pass the act"
  unionstate.18.b:0 "We should avoid this."
  unionstate.19.t:0 "Industrial Resources"

  unionstate.20.d:0 "The America First Union Party is the only party of the American Union State and is governed by the Grand Council of the America First Union Party.

  unionstate.20.a:0 "One country, one party."
  unionstate.21.t:0 "The House of Representatives and the House of Corporations"
  unionstate.21.d:0 "The Congress of American Union State has two chambers. The House of Representatives and the House of Corporations. Members of the House of Representatives are chosen on direct elections whereas those of the House of Corporations are chosen by interest groups, who also choose the Speaker of the House of Corporations (who acts as Minister of Armament)."
  unionstate.21.a:0 "A new Congress!"
  unionstate.22.t:0 "The Supreme Court"
  unionstate.22.d:0 "The Supreme Court represents the just system of the American Union State. Its duty is not only to charge and convict those guilty of treason and crime against the state, but also to review normal cases of national importance. The Chairman of the Supreme Court is the Minister of Security."
  unionstate.22.a:0 "Justice for all!"

Let the elections begin!"
  unionstate.23.a:0 "We are a free country!"
  unionstate.24.t:0 "The Grand Council of the America First Union Party"
  unionstate.24.d:0 "The America First Union Party must choose its direction. Lindbergh wants a more open and democratic country, Long and Smith are concentrated on the economic development of the nation, Coughlin want to focus on the internal affairs of the country. Kuhn's militaristic rhetoric is more interventionist."

  unionstate.26.a:0 "Lindbergh knows what's best for the country"

  unionstate.36.t:0 "The Long Doctrine"
  unionstate.36.d:0 "With the American Union State firmly established, defeating the syndicates in Central and South America was necessary to ensure the security of the new state. A strong position would allow for interventionism against the syndicates before they could successfully secure a position in the Western Hemisphere. Some were concerned that the AUS was spreading itself thin and that internal issues should be addressed first."
  unionstate.36.a:0 "Syndicalism must be stopped."
  unionstate.36.b:0 "America first."
  unionstate.37.t:0 "The American Union Navy"
  unionstate.37.d:0 "The American Union was one of the weakest naval powers of the world. The AUS would be unable to guard its trade routes should a war erupt. There were different schools of thought on the issue as some wanted a blue water navy that could go toe to toe with European powers and others believed that a strong raider force would be preferable as it would be cheaper and easier to build."

  unionstate.37.b:0 "Raiders will strike our enemies everywhere."
  unionstate.38.t:0 "The Syndicate Threat"
  unionstate.38.d:0 "With the fall of Berlin serious questions about the American Union's security were raised. Syndicate domination of Europe was not in the American Union's best interest. Debate as to what action the AUS should take was becoming a major issue. Most were in favour of supporting Germany in its war against the syndicates but an isolationist movement was forming to keep America out of a foreign war."
  unionstate.38.a:0 "We should remain neutral"
  unionstate.38.b:0 "We need to send support!"
  unionstate.38.c:0 "War!"
  unionstate.38.e:0 "Join Mitteleuropa!"
  unionstate.39.t:0 "The Issue of New England"
  unionstate.39.d:0 "The independence of the state of New England had been a contentious issue for the government of the AUS. The reintegration of the state back into the American Union had been made the highest priority and it was unlikely that the government would be deterred by a possible war with the Entente. The stakes were high for the American Union State."
  unionstate.39.a:0 "Demand their return"
  unionstate.39.b:0 "We should not risk it"
  unionstate.40.t:0 "Canada Responds to the AUS Demands"
  unionstate.40.d:0 "The alliance between New England and Canada had been one of opportunity but the demand made by the AUS caused strain. The conservatives led by the King were unwilling to alienate Long over New England but others did not wish to abandon New England after what they had been through."
  unionstate.40.a:0 "The King is right. We need the AUS"
  unionstate.40.b:0 "We must stand by our friends"
  unionstate.41.t:0 "New England Stands Alone"
  unionstate.41.d:0 "The Entente has abandoned New England to the hands of the AUS. The people of New England have very little hope of overcoming the AUS and the feeling in the state is that they have very little hope."

  unionstate.42.a:0 "Excellent"
  unionstate.43.t:0 "New England Refuses Our Demands"
  unionstate.43.d:0 "New England has refused to accept our demands and it is causing a great deal of dissent in the country. The people do not wish another war but it may be inevitable because of how New England has responded."
  unionstate.43.a:0 "Outrageous. We will destroy them."
  unionstate.43.b:0 "Another war is intolerable."
  unionstate.44.t:0 "Entente supports New England!"
  unionstate.44.d:0 "The Entente will support New England against the AUS. But, the people of New England feel they still have very little hope of overcoming the AUS and the feeling in the state is that they should surrender anyway."

  unionstate.44.b:0 "...but to fight!"
  unionstate.45.t:0 "New England Stands Alone"
  unionstate.45.d:0 "New England stands alone against the AUS and most of the people in New England are unwilling to fight the AUS. Surrender seems inevitable."

  unionstate.50.t:0 "The Pacific Question"
  unionstate.50.d:0 "The American Union state had been victorious in the war and now was forced to deal with the PSA. The Pacific states were rich in resources and the government was unfriendly to the AUS so removing that threat was an option but some less radical elements believed that the AUS had been at war enough and that a further war would put unnecessary strain on the delicate hold the government had."
  unionstate.50.a:0 "War will end this!"
  unionstate.50.b:0 "We should try and coexist with neighbours."
  unionstate.51.t:0 "The Mexican Question"
  unionstate.51.d:0 "With territory of the former USA under our firm control, time has come to directly implement the Long doctrine and eradicate syndicalism from America. We should start with our southern neighbour - Mexico. The incompetence of the previous governments allowed Syndicalism to root deeply within Mexican society. The only way how to solve this matter is direct military confrontation..."

  unionstate.53.d:0 "The occupation of American overseas territory by foreign powers during the Civil War was an affront to the Union State.
