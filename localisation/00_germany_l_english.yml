### Focustree ###
GER_doctrine_new:0 "Military Reform"
GER_doctrine_new_desc:0 "After the death of Hans von Seeckt and the retirement of August von Mackensen, the Chief of General Staff has been involved in constant debate over which methods the German Army should use as a tactical basis, or doctrine. "
GER_doctrine_great_war:0 "Trench Weaponry"
GER_doctrine_great_war_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg was won in the trenches. The core part of any army for the last twohundred years has been artillery and infantry, and so it shall remain!"
GER_doctrine_great_war_2:0 "Weltkrieg School" 
GER_doctrine_great_war_2_desc:0 "By expanding on lessons learned during the weltkrieg we can improve our military strategy."
GER_doctrine_mobile:0 "Motorized Divisions"
GER_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "While a machine-gun nest and a trench is almost impassable to infantry, panzers have shown that modern war need not be stale and immobile. While we should lean back on a large infantry army, armored fists should be utilized to tear enemy lines apart."
GER_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "Mobility School"
GER_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "Swift maneuvers, encircling and cutting off pockets of resistance is the way of the future. Motorized infantry can reach tactically important locations in days where traditional infantry would need weeks. The trenches of the Weltkrieg are a thing of the past. For good."
GER_doctrine_mobile_3:0 "Raise new Panzer Divisions"
GER_doctrine_mobile_3_desc:0 "With the doctrines laid out for us, several new panzer divisions should be raised. \n [This will, over time, feed you armored divisions through events.]"
GER_mil_expansion_naval_1:0 "Expand The Naval Industry"
GER_mil_expansion_naval_1_desc:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands unchallenged in any sea on the planet. For now. The Union of Britain, The French, The Americans and the Japanese will all jealously try to outdo us. If left unchecked, our naval domination will end. We should continue the large navy modernization project initiated back in 1934."
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing:0 "Heed the words of Dönitz"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing_desc:0 "The highly respected and talented Karl Dönitz reminds us that the success of ocean-going navies is centered around the success of their Battleships. Our fleets should strive for large, decisive battles and destroy our opposition before they get a chance to intercept and harass our important and valuable shipping routes."
GER_doctrine_base_strike:0 "Listen to Patzig and Raeder"
GER_doctrine_base_strike_desc:0 "Patzig and Raeder have, in close communication with Sperrle of the Luftwaffe, devised a type of naval strategy reliant on mobile air-bases through Aircraft carriers. These men are convinced that on the opean sea, where air cover cannot be provided from inland bases, the Aircraft carrier will dominate naval warfare for years to come."
GER_naval_plans:0 "Deutschland rule the waves"
GER_naval_plans_desc:0 "With our naval strategy laid out before us, the final necessary steps are at hand. Several of our ship constructions have been lying in hiatus during our staggering economy and political unrest. Now however is the time to resume and finish them. \n [This will, over time, feed you ships through events.]"
GER_doctrine_last:0 "Restructure the Chains of Command"
GER_doctrine_last_desc:0 "While centralization has its benefits, modern war requires decentralized command, allowing lower ranking officers more personal initiative to improvise in response to the current situation. This idea, called Auftragstaktik, must be the bread and butter of the modern German army."
GER_security:0 "Status of the FAUD"
GER_security_desc:0 "The FAUD have for a long time been a thorn in the side of German Society, promoting syndicalist ideals to the common man. The Kaiser feels worried that they may cause great unrest if left unchecked... But the politicians of the Reichstag warn that banning the party could turn them even more radical... and violent. Whatever path we go, we must tread it carefully."

 gerdom.1.t:0 "Constitution of the German Reich"
 gerdom.1.d:0 "Signed in 1871 after the crushing defeat of Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation  between representatives of North German Federation and four southern German states this constitution was a cornerstone for enlarging North German Federation thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich. According to the constitution, head of state or a president of Confederation bearing title of German Emperor is the King of Prussia as the president of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. The Emperor installs the Chancellor, the head of government. Laws are enacted by the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 21 years. Hovewer it is Emperor, not Bundesrat or Reichstag, who holds power in the German Empire. With an option to dissolve Reichstag when he wish so, it is clear, that main political power in German Empire rests not in Reichstag as ultimate expression of peoples will, but in the hands of unelected German Emperor."
 gerdom.1.a:0 "Constitution guarantees stability, at least."
 gerdom.2.t:0 "Hans von Seeckt dies"
 gerdom.2.d:0 "Our Chief of General Staff, Hans von Seeckt, has died today in Berlin. The hero of the Intervention in China passed away peacefully in his sleep. Our nation is mourning the loss of a true German hero."

 gerdom.3.t:0 "A State Funeral for a war hero"
 gerdom.3.d:0 "A state funeral has been given for Hans von Seeckt. All important dignitaries were in attendance. Afterward, the Chief of the Army, August von Mackensen, could be seen whispering something to the Kaiser."

 gerdom.4.t:0 "August von Mackensen retires"
 gerdom.4.d:0 "August von Mackensen has delivered his official retirement message to the Kaiser, wearing his trademark Life Hussar uniform. The Field Marshal is already eighty-six years old, and wishes merely to live out his days in peace. The Kaiser accepted the resignation, and ordered a celebration in his honour."
 gerdom.4.a:0 "This might be the time to reform our military."
 gerdom.5.t:0 "Reorganization of the Army"
 gerdom.5.d:0 "With new doctrines calling for a mobile tank force, Germany has begun to form dedicated tank divisions to break through enemy lines. The Army is looking with favour on the new equipment."

 gerdom.7.d:0 "With our economy having declined greatly after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. Another part of our colonial empire that has been put under harsh scrutiny from various commisions is Sri Lanka. They are complaining that upkeep is too high since this island is of only little use to the German Empire. To help with our deficit it has been proposed that we grant natives autonomy or sell island to Princely Federation. What shall we do?"
 gerdom.7.a:0 "Keep Sri Lanka under our control"
 gerdom.7.b:0 "Grant natives autonomous status within German Empire"
 gerdom.7.c:0 "Offer Sri Lanka to the Princely Federation"
 gerdom.8.t:0 "The sale of Sri Lanka"

 gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
 gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the agricultural sector of German economy is one of the most vunerable to turmoil. With this in mind, several junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and subsidies to their production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strenghten this important sector of the Reich's economy. Such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, however, as they are greatly dependant in trade with gerdomy. The wheat crops in the Ukraine are particularly vulnerable."
 gerdom.11.a:0 "We must protect our own peasants."
 gerdom.11.b:0 "We must uphold our foreign obligations."
 gerdom.12.t:0 "The increasing activity of the suffragist movement"
 gerdom.12.d:0 "Lately there has been a rise in activity of the supporters of women's suffrage, that is those who want to grant women the right to vote and to run for office. In this troubled times for the German Empire, it is not easy to choose the best solution. Granting them what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, especially the members of the Reichstag (currently elected by universal male suffrage). On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to riots and more protests, especially in the more liberal states (that already permitted female voting in regional assemblies). The third possibility is a compromise: granting women the right to vote and be elected in the local assemblies of all the constituent members of the Empire. But this last solution might only postpone the problem for the present time and we might have to deal with these suffragist again in the near future."
 gerdom.12.a:0 "Grant universal voting rights for all women !"
 gerdom.12.b:0 "Grant women voting rights in all local assemblies !"
 gerdom.12.c:0 "Refuse such preposterous demands!"
 gerdom.13.t:0 "German women demand recognition for their war effort"
 gerdom.13.d:0 "In the great war against the French syndicalist, German women have proven their loyalty and support for the Empire. Some of them proved fundamental for our propaganda efforts and many of them started working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence. For these reason, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again the government to grant women the right to vote and to run for office."
 gerdom.13.a:0 "Grant universal voting rights for all women !"
 gerdom.13.b:0 "They shall have voting rights in all local assemblies !"

 gerdom.14.d:0 "With the devastating economic situation, many families struggle to earn their daily bread and the social security net is strained beyond the breaking point. Now in the last weeks, the streets of many german cities have been increasingly terrorized by gangs of teenagers. These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism, to escape boredom and frustration. More and more citizens do not feel safe anymore on the streets."
 gerdom.14.a:0 "Oh mein Gott! Shocking!"
 gerdom.15.t:0 "Organise the Youth"
 gerdom.15.d:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness displayed by parts of our nation's youth is to organise them into youth organisations, so that they can learn new skills and use their energies for the public good. The german pathfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."
 gerdom.15.a:0 "This won't be necessary"
