SOM_iron_fist_of_warsangali_desc:0 "Warsangali is the de facto and de jure leader of Somalia, with its powerbase strong and deep German and Ottoman foreign ties dating back from the Weltkrieg.

SOM_foodplease:0 "Food Shortages"
SOM_foodplease_desc:0 "The prosperity Somalia has been in, with urbanisation, foreign investment and a true cultural renaissance, is not without bad sides.

SOM_BM:0 "Black Monday Hits the Horn"
SOM_BM_desc:0 "While in a comparatively less harsh fashion than in other places, even the small ripples of the crisis that reach Somalia were enough to trash much of our few industries as foreign capital returns home, panicked. We need to act!"

SOM_strenght_desc:0 "While the prosperity and development of Somalia is remarkable, Ali Shire followed a 'let sleeping dogs lie' policy with the political question. Somalis rejoiced their freedom, and did not question the primacy of Las Khorey. However, news of administrative reform in Abssinya and Egypt convinced the Boqor that the reforms are, indeed, needed if Somalia is to preserve its independence"
SOM_gendarmerie_desc:0 "Keeping order has been traditionally a role of local militias; we trusted every chief to look after the people. However, to ensure peace and security in our new empire, we have to outfit a force of men that is capable of containing riots, protests, revolts and crimes, a Gendarmierie, based on European models, but on Turkish and Caliphal uniforms"
SOM_negotiate_desc:0 "The model of the German Empire is a wise one, and pleases many among our Shieks, Suldaans and other rulers. The Boqor will rule as First Among Equals, and every clan, no matter how small, will be a federal unit of Somalia"
SOM_unitedinwill_desc:0 "United in Will"
SOM_theassembly_desc:0 "Each clan, no matter how small, elects now a councilman or two for the newly founded National Assembly of Clans, which serves as a lower house beneath the House of Lords"
SOM_constituitionreform_desc:0 "A formal Constitution limiting the powers of States, Territories and of the Union ensures that the pacts signed in the last few months will not be but empty promises"
SOM_landofthefree_desc:0 "Now that the entirety of the rules are on the table, its on the people's hands to choose Somalia's future. Let the Elections begin!"
SOM_justicetraditionsa_desc:0 "Xeer, or customary law, has always been something of a legal grey area. However, we will regulate it in such a way that each state and clan regulates it's laws to an extent, but each local set of laws is beneath Somali State Law, therefore ending the contradictions and loops that existed before"
SOM_crackdownonclanism_desc:0 "For too long the minor lords of Somalia held sway on our decisions. The facade of a federation must be extinguished!"
SOM_unityistrenght_desc:0 "Somalia is one nation, of one people, under one Sovereign. We fought long and hard to build our future, and infighting cannot compromise it!"
SOM_formalizekingdomstructure_desc:0 "Somalia is to be, for all intents and proposes, a centralised kingdom where the Monarch's control is nearly absolute. After a referendum, of course! "
SOM_tfwnoclans_desc:0 "The elections are to be held, a shroud of formality to silent liberalist dissent. However, turnout is to have at least a minimum; that will take some effort on the Propaganda front. Let us remind the people who really fought alongside Hassan and his brave men, and who cowered and licked Italian boots as long as possible"
SOM_forthegreatergood_desc:0 "Enemies about at every corner. Knifes in the dark, ready to strike at the elderly, fragile Boqor who gave so much of his life selflessly for his people. Traitors will be dealt with; swithfly and efficiently."
SOM_finishgovermentreforms_desc:0 "With the future of the nation safeguarded, the tomorrow is brighter than ever. Now we must plan for it..."
SOM_economicaldev_desc:0 "While our population has grown prosperous, we need to make sure that this prosperity is not something that will pass, by developing the economy into an industrial one. Our valued partners in the Porte and in Berlin will help us in this endeavour."
SOM_basicinfra_desc:0 "A nation as young as Somalia will always need investments linking provinces and regions; especially if we are to truly modernise."
SOM_cashcrops_desc:0 "While we still have some hunger problems, we need reserves to tackle them; the best option is to intensify cash crop production for a short while"
SOM_endhunger_desc:0 "Measures are to be taken to stop hunger in Somalia; we started with increasing arable land and buying small amounts of foreign grain and foodstuffs"
SOM_endhunger2_desc:0 "Hunger is no longer a part of Somali life, neither rural or urban. New Somalia's future is bright!"
SOM_blackmonday_desc:0 "While not hit nearly as hard as other nations closer to the German economic orbit (or indeed involved in international trade more than ourselves), Somalia has suffering an economic downturn. This must not stand; Actions must be taken!"
SOM_warindustries_desc:0 "War has changed. We cannot hope to preserve Somalia if we are to fight in the way our forefathers did, modern equipment and tactics are needed"
SOM_foreignmethods_desc:0 "Our few military factories must be working at absolutely top capacity if we are to stand defiant of our imperialistic neighbours"
SOM_prepareforwar_desc:0 "War is coming to Somalia. It is foolish to presume otherwise, for the envious powers in Adis Ababa refuse to acknowledge the simple fact of the loss of Ogaden, a region they never truly controlled. Our preparations must be swift and efficient"
SOM_lisencsingdeals_desc:0 "We need help for foreign experts, and foreign blueprints, if our military is to meet the standards of modern war"
SOM_infra2thereinfraning_desc:0 "Connecting the nation from Barwara all the way Zeila, in railways and roads, is the utmost priority. Our produce, our people and our armies cannot rely on dirt roads"
SOM_actualportsandairports_desc:0 "Our ports have met our needs until now, but increased production of both agricultural and industrial goods means that pressure for public investment in the are is increasing especially among coastal Lords."
SOM_pansomaliethos_desc:0 "Pan Somali ideas have long flourished in circles of intellectuals and militarymen in our young nation. Now, the time to act nears; Every Somali will be under our flag!"
SOM_statefunded_national_revival_desc:0 "Our great nation had a glorious past, and has ahead of it an even glorious future. But sponsoring personalities and teachers who acknowledge this, and investing on our national pride, we can truly make every man proud to be Somalu"
SOM_put_down_the_lion_desc:0 "There are few things more pitiful than an old, sickly lion. Once a powerful empire, who harboured the faithful in their hour of greatest need, now Abssinya is little more than an amalgamation of scheming dukes who play dress-up as German Officers. It's high time we put his great empire to rest"
SOM_civilianindustry_desc:0 "Our people can afford new goods, but we need to pay too much to import them here. Perhaps we should make them right here instead?"
SOM_constructechnics_desc:0 "Refroming a nation is no easy job. We will need foreign expertise and personnel if Somalia is to be hurled into the next age of progress"
SOM_consumergoods_desc:0 "Our consumer goods industry is limited by the market demand we have locally. BY making cheaper goods and exporting some produce to nearby regions, we can ensure that our industries grow as expected of a fast developing nation such as ours"
SOM_politicalgoodwill_desc:0 "While much of our goverment has still something of a provisional air to it, we must strive towards uniting and consolidating alliances with clan leaders and intellectuals"
SOM_increasealphabetusage_desc:0 "Cusmaan Yuusuf Keenadiid, the Suldaan of Hobyo, is a well learned man, who designed a new script of the Somali Language. While his Alphabet has had in the past widespread accliam and usage in high learning centres, we will now expand and officially endorse it to the official script of the Somali Language"
SOM_techslot_desc:0 "The most prepared and intelligent students will now be granted higher education, and our universities will be bustling with new students and ideas. Of course, this also means that the state can take advantage of these newly qualified individuals"
SOM_techslot2_desc:0 "War is something that is not easily predicted. After all, our nation's generals need constant updates themselves, as do our engineers and planners who ready our machines of war"
SOM_higherlearning_desc:0 "Somalia's higher learning is still lacking, especially if the nation is to be taken seriously among the global academia. Heavy investments, and the opening of more universities outside of Mogadishu, will make sure that every region has a place of higher learning nearby, and local militia officers have the skills required to conduct themselves in battle"
SOM_royalarmy_desc:0 "Reforming the army is more than simply appoint new men to new stations. Mentality, equipment and focuses all must change, and the priorities of a modern military force are a beast of their own"
SOM_reformsreorgan_desc:0 "Army reform is something that is always easier said than done. Now we must decide where to focus our efforts; Should the Army be centralised or autonomous? Of course, such a decision would have deep political consequences, and further efforts will have to be preceded by political reforms"
SOM_clanmilitiaarmament_desc:0 "Every Consituent State must now have its own standing milita, which falls under our umbrella. We will grand them weapons, the clans will grant us the men"
SOM_isthatamiltiagungiseewithabursa_desc:0 "An army of militiamen may be large, but often falls flat against trained foes. We will ensure that we have efficient training regimens"
SOM_clancavreg_desc:0 "Our nobles have a long tradition of horsemanship; we will bring those knights new propouse in fighting for a new Somalia"
SOM_hobyoyards_desc:0 "Besides his studies, the Sultan of Hobyo turned toward the sea, and has made great investments into the shipyards there; it has effectively become one of the major bases of the navy. More is planned, but he requests federal assistance in this endeavor!"
SOM_logisticsformilitoas_desc:0 "An army marches on its stomach, and supplying a decentralised affair such as CSM's is no easy task. We will have men qualified for the task, however"
SOM_jointplanningteams_desc:0 "The best men in Somalia will gather, and from our central planning, all States will strike together as one cohesive unit, in defence of the motherland"
SOM_mobilization_effort_desc:0 "Somalian men, heed the call! Your clan, your family, and your country need you! Join your local forces today, and together with your brothers, we can ensure Somalia never again falls under foreign yoke!"
SOM_magarteenartillery_desc:0 "The sultan of Majarteen knew our safety was transitory, and invested much into an armoury that can make the finest modern artillery, based of Turkish designs he bought from his own pockets. Lets us make and effort and join forces for Somalia"
SOM_moblity_desc:0 "Mobile Army Doctrine"
SOM_advanced_naval_engagements_desc:0 "Naval Combat Theory"
SOM_onkod_warfare_desc:0 "Our irregular forces have long been our backbone; following the footsteps of Hasan, whom the defeated imperialists call the Mad Mullah, we will move swiftly through the lands we know, and strike hard in the ones we dont, to secure Somalia's future"
SOM_unfiedarmy_desc:0 "The army is an extension of the state. It will keep the peace and be modernised in a highly centralised fashion, following the lead of european states."
SOM_factory_desc:0 "We must ensure that we have enough factories to properly supply a modern military. Such an effort will be highly costly however."
SOM_planning_strategically_desc:0 "Our officers, earger to learn the ways of modern war, will have aid of foreign experts and ensure that we can defeat the enemies of Somalia both on a tatical and strategical level"
SOM_tankbuy_desc:0 "Tanks are expensive, hard to make and hard to mantain. They would however be an invaluable asset in the wars to come, especially since our enemies will in all likelyhood not posses any!"
SOM_factory2_desc:0 "Our factories must be bustling hubs, not of consumer goods, but of military ones. We must be well supplied and equipped!"
SOM_equipment_desc:0 "Our men need to gain trust in the reformed army, no better way to ensure that than new boots, new guns and better butter"
SOM_modern_guns_desc:0 "Our artillery pieces and handguns are almost relics of the Weltkrieg era, some even before that. We truly need new equipment to modernize our forces"
SOM_support_eq_desc:0 "Secondary equipment and logistical support will be the focus now our our military renewal efforts. Support Brigade training is something new, and will demand effort"
SOM_thatsthepointsarge_desc:0 "The best of the best, handpicked men from Las Khorey, will be the elite forces of Somalia, loyal to the country and Boqor above all else"
SOM_military_doctrine_effort_desc:0 "Wars are ecloding around the world, and we must stay aware of tactical and strategical developments in these troubled times, and find ways to apply them in defence of our land"
SOM_support_companies_desc:0 "Support Companies will be vital in future war efforts, but to establish them we will have to bring over foreign officers and especially train men, which is all in all an expensive adventure"
SOM_inthenavy_desc:0 "Somalia stands at a crossroads, and it's strategical importance cannot be understated. If we manage to organise a powerful navy and an airforce, we could wrest control of the world's busiest shipping lines... a tempting prospect"
SOM_royalnavy_desc:0 "Somalia's warships are little more than second hand Weltkrieg ships, which the Great Powers happily sold us. If we are to control the seas, the Royal Navy will need a reform, among officers, sailors and the ships themselves"
SOM_buildup_desc:0 "We will start a large scale naval buildup to wrest control of the seas. An expensive, but hopefully fruitful effort"
SOM_strategicpatrols_desc:0 "By using our ships to control shipping lanes near our coastline, we can ensure that our influence is heard and seen by all sailors in the Horn, and defend our own supplies much more effciently"
SOM_constrycnava_desc:0 "We should heavily invest in our own shipyards if our navy is to be self sufficient and defend us"
SOM_raiders_desc:0 "Our position near shipping lanes puts us in a prime position to take advantaged of submarines, to strike into enemy convoys with great efficiency"
SOM_hunterpacks_desc:0 "Raiding parties will be set up, and no convoy of the enemy will escape the horn unscathed!"
SOM_controlofnearbyseas_desc:0 "controlling such an strategic seazone will be a gruesome effort, but well worth the gamble if we succeed. Plans are to be made..."
SOM_flagshipexperiments_desc:0 "Our small, young nation could be seen as not needing a massive flagship. However, we will have to defend our ports sooner or later, and small raiders will not be suffient for that"
SOM_airforce_desc:0 "Our few planes were bough nearly a decade ago from the Caliph, and the Royal Airforce is in dire need of updating and investment. Let's see to it"
SOM_fighters_desc:0 "Aerial combat should be about controlling the skies, not the air. For once is one is won, the other will shortly follow"
SOM_fighters2_desc:0 "We must spare to expense to ensure that only Somalian aircraft flies in the skies above, for to lose control of the skies is a dangerous gamble at best"
SOM_bombers_desc:0 "Aarial combat should be about controlling the land, not the skies. For its in the ground, with solid boots, that wars are won!"
SOM_bombers2_desc:0 "Our bomber crews are still new to this, and a few European and Caliphal officers will be needed to ensure our designs are modern and our pilots prepared"
SOM_airdoc_desc:0 "Planning is perhaps the most important facet of any airborne mission. We must ensure our officers are prepared and qualified to the dangers of war in the sky"

#events

som.1.t:0 "United We Stand!"
som.1.d:0 "Somalia's multiple states were easy prey to colonialists; divided we fell. But then, in the Weltkrieg, the long struggle of Abullah Hassan, called 'mad' by our enemies, ended in victory; after a string of victories here and in Europe, Italy completely withdrew from Somalia, and the Sultan of Warsangali de facto slipped from British Authority, who was too busy fighting Germany around the world. The Peace With Honour did mean Somalia was free, but paradoxically, still a protectorate of Britain due to Ali Shire's treaties; a Stautus quo which seemingly benefited both parties. After British collapse, Warsangali's forces seized what was left of British Somaliland, and the lords who were allied to him in a loose fashion proclaimed him Emperor, or Boqor, of Somalia. However, he styled himself King in the west, perhaps in an attempt to court the Emperors of the central powers, and placing himself below the Caliph, whose primacy and aid is thoroughly recognised. Prosperity followed, even after the French Flu; our fields grow rich and our cites larger, and our control over Ogaden is absolute, and little Abssinya can do to contest it for now. The roads, universities and books are all symptoms of Somali Renaissance, but great danger might be ahead, for the wise know good times don't last forever. Halie Selassie eyes us enviously, and Mittelafrika's new manager seems to be rather unapproachable diplomatically. Whatever the future holds, we know that we seized the opportunity, and together we are leading Somalia to a bright future"
som.1.a:0 "Somalia stands in the shoulders of giants!"
som.2.t:0 "Black Monday Ripples reach Somalia"
som.2.d:0 "While in a comparatively weak fashion, Somalia has been hit by black Monday. Our most valuable trading partners are no longer willing to trade, and the people worry about the future, making the downturn of the economy a self fulfilling prophecy!"
som.2.a:0 "Uh Oh"
som.3.t:0 "Elections Called!"
som.3.d:0 "The elections of the lower house will be a good gauge of which factions will bet he most influential in the House of Clans, and the House of Lords will follow. The prime minister from the winning party will be appointed by the Boqor, as predicted in the constitution. But who takes the most votes? Three parties have a realistic chance to triumph; The Somali Youth League, the Liberal Party and the Royal Party, which effectively mantains the status quo. And the people decided that..."
som.3.a:0 "The Royal Loyalists, win the the elections, and Cismaan III becomes Prime Minister"
som.3.b:0 "the Liberal Party wins the elections, and Ughaz Warfa becomes Prime Minister"
som.3.c:0 "The Somali Youth League wins the elections, and Osman Shermake becomes Prime Minister"
som.7.t:0 "Hasan and the History books"
som.7.d:0 "Mohhamed Abdullah Hassan, or the Mad Mullah as he is known abroad, let the war against Britain and Italy during the Weltkrieg, and ensured our freedom for generations to come. However, the man was averted to personal representaions, as his faith was iconoclast, and believed photos would steal his soul and trap it; or so the saying goes. The fact is, we have no idea what he looked like besides second hand accounts. How our history books will portray him?"
som.7.a:0 "Allow representations of him , our young need heroes"
som.7.b:0 "Let us craft an image of him, idealised and brave, standing for the man he was, and not his old age"
som.7.c:0 "We will respect the man's faith and personal wishes. Warriors do not read books anyhow!"
som.4.t:0 "The Hangash captures subversive elements"
som.4.d:0 "It would be unwise to share more details, my lord, but suffice to say these terrorists were planning to ruin Somalia and sell it to foreign invaders. Don't worry, the threat has been dealt with"
som.4.a:0 "Excellent"
som.5.t:0 "A Referendum"
som.5.d:0 "The people must now approve of our reforms, and confirm our status as supreme rulers of Somalia. The 'No' campaign , shockingly, ran into many... difficulties, and therefore a win is certain. All that is left to do is a toast!"
som.5.a:0 "Everything is going as we have foreseen"
som.6.t:0 "Clan Argument!"
som.6.d:0 "Two major clans have gotten into a disagreement in the House of Lords. Now, both boycott the other's actions and a political crisis is brewing"
som.6.a:0 "That is not good!"
som.8.t:0 "Educational Successes!"
som.8.d:0 "Our new curriculum has gained a surprising amount of traction, and thousands of children are learning the alphabet crafted by our government. Now, the Osmanya script sure will be the most important legacy of our rule"
som.8.a:0 "Every poet started with a word"
som.9.t:0 "Hasnah Doreh Brigade"
som.9.d:0 "To the shock of conservatives, a group of young, educated women and their husbands have organised themselves into a brigade to fight for Somalia against the German Puppets in Adis Ababa. They named themselves the Hasnah Doreh Brigdade, after the wife of Abdullah Hassan who allegedly fought alongside him"
som.9.a:0 "Everyone is doing their part!"
som.10.t:0 "All Men to Stations!"
som.10.d:0 "Volunteers and reserve forces have gathered for our war against Abssinya! None shall stand in the path of the Somali people!"
