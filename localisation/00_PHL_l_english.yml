phil.1.t:0 "Syndicalist uprising in Manilla"
phil.1.d:0 "As we have peacefully achieved independence from the United States due to their chaotic Civil War, our young Commonwealth is already facing the dangers of syndicalism. Inspired by both the Combined Syndicates' uprising in America and by the Bhartiya Commune in India, a group of disgruntled army officers have ordered their units to march towards our capital, where they have joined forces with bands of peasants and industrial workers.
