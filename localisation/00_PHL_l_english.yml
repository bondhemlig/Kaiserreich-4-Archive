phil.1.t:0 "Syndicalist uprising in Manilla"
phil.1.d:0 "As we have peacefully achieved independence from the United States due to their chaotic Civil War, our young Commonwealth is already facing the dangers of syndicalism. Inspired by both the Combined Syndicates' uprising in America and by the Bhartiya Commune in India, a group of disgruntled army officers have ordered their units to march towards our capital, where they have joined forces with bands of peasants and industrial workers. They are planning to establish a socialist republic on our archipelago!"
phil.1.a:0 "Rebels seize the capital and prepare to establish a syndicalist regime"
phil.1.b:0 "Order our forces to resist the uprising"
phil.2.t:0 "A counter-coup?"
phil.2.d:0 "Despite the syndicalist-sympatizing units seizing most of downtown Manilla, most of the armed forces are still siding with the legal government. Will they join the revolutionaries?"
phil.2.a:0 "The army joins the rebels and the government is toppled"
phil.2.b:0 "Loyal units storm the capital and evict the syndicalists"
phil.3.t:0 "II Himagsikang Pilipino"
phil.3.d:0 "The Phillipine armed forces have declared their loyalty to the new government and a socialist republic has been declared. This is the ushering of a new era for out land!"
phil.3.a:0 "Viva Rebolusyon!"
phil.4.t:0 "The Revolution is Defeated"
phil.4.d:0 "As the armed forces declared their support for our government, the rebellious units quickly lost support. After one of our generals drove an armoured column towards downtown Manilla, the syndicalists officially surrendered, ending the threat of a left-wing coup in our country. With the army occupying key points in the city, however, a new menace looms over the horizon - there are talks that the military may attempt to take the chance to seize power for themselves and establish a dictatorship of their own..."
phil.4.a:0 "The army restores the legal government to power"
phil.4.b:0 "A military dictatorship is established"
phil.5.t:0 "Democracy prevails"
phil.5.d:0 "As the armed forces declared their support for our government, the rebellious units quickly lost support. After one of our generals drove an armoured column towards downtown Manilla, the syndicalists officially surrendered, ending the threat of a left-wing coup in our country."
phil.5.a:0 "Great!"
