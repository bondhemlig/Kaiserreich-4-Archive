 # Mobilize Event
 ire.1.t:0 "Mobilizing the Defense Reserves"
 ire.1.d:0 "Éire finds herself once again in a grave crisis. Our strategic planners foresaw that this day would come, and now that we are at war, it is time to make good use of their foresight. Brave sons of Ireland await the command across the nation to take up arms and defend their country from foreign aggressors." 
 ire.1.a:0 "We need them all."
 ire.1.b:0 "A half company will do."
 ire.1.c:0 "Call up only the infantry reserves."
 
  # Introduction Event
 ire.2.t:0 "The State of the Republic, 1936"
 ire.2.d:0 "After countless years of arduous rebellion and weathering oppressive British rule, the Irish people have won their freedom, and their country back. But as one enemy was vanquished, another rose in her place, perhaps yet more dangerous still. Michael Collins sits a relucant dictator, eager to defend the independence of his nation at any cost, yet his political enemies are many. Ireland is a powder keg, and it's only a matter of time until it explodes." 
 ire.2.a:0 "These are turbulent times."
 
 # Unionist Tensions (and debug)
 ire.3.t:0 "Unionist Tensions Debug"

 ire.3.c:0 "Report Unionist Tensions"
 ire.4.t:0 "Ulster at Peace"
 ire.4.d:0 "After the recent unrest, the people of Ulster seem to once again be at peace. There's no telling for how long this peace will last, but there's no doubt that Ireland is better off for it. The Dáil have one less issue to deal with."
 ire.4.a:0 "What a relief."
 ire.5.t:0 "Disgruntled Populace in Ulster"
 ire.5.d:0 "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Unionists, who advocate for closer ties with England, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil. If this situation is not handled carefully, the issues that divide the region are sure to grow more incendiary."
 ire.5.a:0 "This is a delicate matter."
 ire.6.t:0 "Radical Movements Mobilizing"
 ire.6.d:0 "In response to what they see as oppressive policies towards the people of Ulster, Unionist organisations are growing more radical and attracting the most disenfranchised and angry Northerners to their cause. They are presently meeting in secret in pubs and Orange Order halls around the country, safe from the prying eyes of the Gardaí."
 ire.6.a:0 "Bloody radicals."
 ire.7.t:0 "Riots in Belfast"
 ire.7.d:0 "The streets of Belfast are in an uproar after the Unionists have began to make their play for a general uprising. Disgruntled Ulstermen, the vast majority of which are Protestants, have taken to the streets in a violent stand against what they believe to be hostile intentions from Dublin. The Dáil has called an emergency meeting to address their grievances, but that may not be enough to stop them."
 ire.7.a:0 "Madness."
 ire.8.t:0 "Civil War Imminent"
 ire.8.d:0 "All measures, peaceful or otherwise, to try and pacify Ulster has failed. The Ulster Unionists, backed by the Ulster Volunteer Force, have announced their independence from Ireland and have declared that they will defend the province of Ulster to the death from Dublin, and Catholic, rule. A civil war is inevitable."
 ire.8.a:0 "God help us."
 
 # IEAA event - Collins in charge
 ire.9.t:0 "The Dáil Considers the Economy"
 ire.9.d:0 "With the passing of the Irish Economic Advancement Act (IEAA), a commitment by the Irish government to a rapid and complete overhaul of the economy has been made. As stipulated in the act, the government must now decide on an annual focus to improve the economy. Michael Collins, President of the Republic and leader of Fine Gael, believes that Ireland should focus on building up it's industry as quickly as possible. A Syndicalist coalition led by Jim Larkin argue that giving power to the workers' unions is the best way to increase our nations productivity. Sinn Féin suggest a focus on mainstream industrial research and development, whilst the Conservatives believe developing our electronics industry would suit Ireland better."
 ire.9.a:0 "Collins has the right idea."
 ire.9.b:0 "The Conservative plan is a winner."
 ire.9.c:0 "Side with the Democrats and Liberals."
 ire.9.e:0 "The Syndicalists are on to something."
 
 # IEAA repeat event - Collins still in charge
 ire.10.t:0 "The Dáil Considers the Economy"
 ire.10.d:0 "As in previous years, the Dáil are meeting to decide the annual economic focus for the nation. The positions of the main power players in Irish politics has not changed. President Collins advocates for rapid industrialization, whilst the Syndicalists demand more recognition and better treatment for the workers. The Liberal Democratic coalition believe that Ireland is best served by industrial research and development, but the National Centre Party argue that electronics are the future."
 ire.10.a:0 "Collins is always right."
 ire.10.b:0 "The NCP ought to lead the way." 
 ire.10.c:0 "Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil are correct." 
 ire.10.e:0 "The reds might have a good idea for once.."

# Debt Warning Events - Level 0
ire.17.t:0 "The National Debt"
ire.17.d:0 "After the recent passage of the IEAA, the Dáil has held several meetings with financial experts from the Bank of Ireland in order to ascertain the current economic status of the nation. Although there is room for rapid economic growth, it will almost certainly come at the cost of raking up a significant national debt. Ireland's treasury is currently understocked after such a long period of British exploitation, and the only way that treasury will grow is through economic reform. The Bank of Ireland suggest a steady and careful approach to expansion, but it is ultimately up to the nations leaders to decide."
ire.17.a:0 "We should monitor this situation closely."

# Level 1

ire.18.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.18.d:0 "Following recent investments by the Irish government into economic and industrial reforms, the national debt has grown slightly. This is presently nothing to worry about, and the Dáil stresses that this investment is necessary for Ireland to have a bright future."
ire.18.a:0 "Well, you need to break a few eggs to make an omelette."

# Level 2

ire.19.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.19.d:0 "Continued investiture by the Irish government into the economic sector has led to a slow growth of the national debt. The situation is still entirely under control, although conservatives among the public are growing slightly concerned at what they feel may be excess spending."
ire.19.a:0 "They call them conservative for a reason."

# Level 3

ire.20.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.20.d:0 "Amidst considerable spending by the Dáil in an effort to improve the nations economy, the national debt has risen considerably in recent times and is now reaching a point where top financial experts in Ireland are forecasting growing problem areas in the economy. This has led to a downfall in public support for the government."
ire.20.a:0 "This was never going to be an easy time."

# Level 4

ire.21.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.21.d:0 "There were protests outside the Dáil this morning in response to what is seen as increasingly reckless and haphazard spending by the government. Whilst it's true that Ireland's economy may be better off in the long-term, the short term effects of the growing national debt are starting to rear their ugly head."
ire.21.a:0 "This is starting to turn ugly."

# Level 5

ire.22.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.22.d:0 "Dangerous and Irresponsible. The damning headline of the Irish Independent this morning leads into an article that strongly criticizes the government for their continued economic spending. Public interest groups are mobilizing and there are fears that Ireland is heading for an economic bubble that could have devastating effects on her economy."
ire.22.a:0 "Time for a change in policy..?"

# Level 6

ire.23.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.23.d:0 "Businesses are starting to shut up shop and foreign investors are quickly beginning to consider transferring or liquidating their assets in Ireland. The stock market in Dublin is said to be heading for a complete crash, and whispers from the Dáil talk about a black hole in the budget. Ireland is on the brink of financial ruin."
ire.23.a:0 "Heads will roll for this."

# Level 7

ire.25.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.25.d:0 "There were riots in the streets today as the Dáil was forced to admit that they may have seriously underestimated the amount of money required to fund their economic investments. As a result, the financial capitulation of Ireland is all but a certainty. The businessmen of Dublin can do little more than sit around, transfixed by the horror of the economic turmoil that is surely soon to come."
ire.25.a:0 "Is it too late for Ireland?"

# Level 8

ire.24.t:0 "The Irish Market Collapses"
ire.24.d:0 "The Dáil is an uproar this morning after the head of government was forced to announce that, regretably, the national debt has grown so immensely large that the state is now officially considered bankrupt by foreign bodies. The Irish market subsequently crashed in less than an hour and people are taking to the streets in droves, prompting the IRA to be deployed to the capital to restore order. Something radical is needed to save the economy!"
ire.24.a:0 "Something radical? That doesn't sound good."

# Debt Reduction Events

ire.26.t:0 "The National Debt Falls"
ire.26.d:0 "The Dáil announced this morning that the national debt has fallen. This will surely be a relief to all Irish people up and down the country."
