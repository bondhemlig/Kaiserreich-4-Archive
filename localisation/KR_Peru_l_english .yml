pru.1.t:0 "Peru in 1936"
pru.1.d:0 "Although factually independent since 1821, Spain recognized the autonomy of her former colony not until 1871 when a peace between the countries was struck after a conflict of the two countries over the Chinchain Islands. An alliance with Bolivia drew the country 1879 till 1883 in a border conflict between Chile and Bolivia in the Atacama Desert (Saltpetre War). During the war Peru lost her provinces of Tarapacá, Arica, and Tacna. British and U.S. financial circles exploited the opportunity, stripping the weakened Peruvian state of their state railroad, nullifying Peru's debts in exchange. Between 1895 and 1930 the domestic situation was consolidated. Newly discovered copper deposits made up for the loss of the Saltpetre provinces for which Peru was compensated in the Treaty of Lima 1929, getting free port access to Arica, receiving back the province of Tacna, and 6 million Dollars. The socialist APRA (Allianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana, founded in 1924) under Victor Raúl Haya de la Torre demanded a land reform and the political and social integration of the Indios who made up 50 percent of the population. In 1931 and 1936 Haya de la Torre failed in the elections. The successes of his party, however, alarmed the military under Oscar Raimundo Benavides who banned the party"
pru.1.a:0 "Whatever the future holds, we'll be ready"
pru.2.t:0 "The 1939 Presidental election"
pru.2.d:0 "It is time for the next Presidential election. The two parties that have a chance at winning are either the Conservative party or the Patriotic Front. The Social Democrat party, because of their connection to the assassination of Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro, the previous president, have been barred from the election..."
pru.2.a:0 "The Conservatives win it!"
pru.2.b:0 "The Patriotic Front win it!"
pru.2.c:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy!"
pru.2.t:0 "The 1944 Presidental election"
pru.2.d:0 "It is time for the next Presidential election. The Social Democrat is back on the ballot and the Conservatives have agreed to a coalition with the Patriotic Front, who will win?"
pru.2.a:0 "The Conservative and Patriotic Front coalition wins it!"
pru.2.b:0 "The Social Democrats wins it!"
pru.2.c:0 "The army shall put an end to this chaotic democracy!"
pru.4.t:0 "Conference with Peru"
pru.4.d:0 "Leading Peruvian economists have proposed that we establish a more favorable entrance of their goods into the Bolivian markets. We could get some money from this, but the people would surelly complain as our own products would suffer with foreign concorrence."
pru.4.a:0 "Accept the Peruvian proposal"
pru.4.b:0 "We are not interested in this"
pru.5.t:0 "Peru proposes a customs union"
pru.5.d:0 "The 1936 economical summit with Peru resulted in some modernization of the Bolivian economy. Despite the initial flooding of foreign products into our markets, soon Bolivia started to receive its profits, as our agricultural and mineral produce entered Peru more easily. Now, the government in Lima wants to promote a customs union and common market between our two countries, removing any existing protectionist barriers. Should we accept their offer?"
pru.5.a:0 "Establish the Andean Common Market"
pru.5.b:0 "This cooperation was a terrible mistake"
pru.6.t:0 "Peru proposes a defense pact"
pru.6.d:0 "The Andean Common Market between Peru and Bolivia has proved a success! Never have our two countries been so rich and prosperous! Now, with South America a volatile continent, some Peruvian politicians have proposed adding a common defensive pact to our string of treaties: an attack against one country would be considered a direct agression against the other..."
pru.6.a:0 "Sign the deal!"
pru.6.b:0 "What a dumb idea!"
pru.7.t:0 "Peru has proposed union between our nations"
pru.7.d:0 "Seeing the dramatical fiscal and geopolitical situation in the South America with Brazil and Argentina rising as new threats on horizont we need to reconsider the peaceful option of uniting both nations. It would prevent Bolivia falling into Syndicalism and bring us greener lands. Alternatively, we could make a counter proposal of an alliance and a more autonomous union"
pru.7.a:0 "Viva la Great Bolivian-Peruvian Union"
pru.7.b:0 "Viva la Great Bolivian-Peruvian Confederation"
pru.7.c:0 "Eat my dirt, Peruanos! We wont give up our independence"
pru.8.t:0 "Peru demands Antofogasta"
pru.8.d:0 "Peru demands we cede Antofogasta and Arica to them, lest they will declare war!"
pru.8.a:0 "We have no option... we must cede the province"
pru.8.b:0 "If they want it, let them come and get it!"
pru.10.t:0 "Berlin Crisis hits the Andes"
pru.10.d:0 "As the Bernin Crisis snowballs out of control, our economy, being mainly one of exports, is on the verge of collapse! The future is grim and uncertain as doznens of investors were found dead in their rooms in Lima"
pru.10.a:0 "Díos Mio!"
pru.11.t:0 "Bolivia expels our embassator"
pru.11.d:0 "Our embassator, who was deeply involved in the Union talks with Bolivia, has been kicked out of the country! This is a gigantic insult!
pru.11.a:0 "Well, if that's how you want this to go..."
pru.12.t:0 "Summit sucessful!"
pru.12.d:0 "Our summit with Boliva has been an astouding success. It's good to have a friend in these troubled times"
pru.12.a:0 "Indeed!"
pru.13.t:0 "Andean Common Market Established"
pru.13.d:0 "With the establishment of an Andean Common Market, our economies will recover from Black Monday much faster!"
pru.13.a:0 "Joyous news!"
pru.14.t:0 "Reestablishment of the Confederation"
pru.14.d:0 "After nearly a century of seperation the two nations of Peru and Bolivia has once again united in their common struggle! Long live the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. May we be the light of South America!"
pru.14.a:0 "Firme por la Unidad!"
pru.15.t:0 "Reestablishment of the Confederation"
pru.15.d:0 "After nearly a century of seperation the two nations of Peru and Bolivia has once again united in their common struggle! Long live the Peru-Bolivian Confederation. May the light of our nations illuminate South America!"
pru.15.a:0 "Firme y feliz por la unión!"
pru.16.t:0 "Treaty of Mutual Defense Accepted!"
pru.16.d:0 "Bolivia has agreed to sign a treaty of mutual defense between our nations!"
pru.16.a:0 "Stronger Together"
pru.17.t:0 "Antofogasta ceded"
pru.17.d:0 "The vile invaders have been driven from Antofogasta
pru.17.a:0 "Many lives were spared!"
pru.18.t:0 "Our demands Refused"
pru.18.d:0 "War it is! The Invaders refuse to give up their occupation of Antofogasta"
pru.18.a:0 "They will soon realize the magnitude of their mistake!"
pru.19.t:0 "Formalize the Union"
pru.19.d:0 "With our armies occupying the former territory of Bolivia, their government in exile in Lima has agreed to reform the confederation to ensure our armies will protect them!
pru.19.a:0 "Firme por la Unidad!"
