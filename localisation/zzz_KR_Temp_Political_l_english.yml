#kr.political.27.t:0 "Cornflakes and DLC"
#kr.political.27.d:0 "Do I need Waking the Tiger? What about Death or Dishonour? Will the universe end in vacuum decay?\n\nNo, you do not need Waking the Tiger or any other DLC to play Kaiserreich Alpha 0.6 - 'Garibaldi's Nightmare', though yes the universe will end in vacuum decay.\n\nWe have been thinking and talking a lot about DLC within the team and what our policy should be surrounding it. We have not yet reached a conclusion and thus we may change things for 0.7, we may not. But until then, enjoy Kaiserreich with all, some or no DLC. That being said, if you do have DLC by all means use it and enjoy those shiny unit models and associated features!\n\nPlease also note that work with 1.5 'Cornflakes' is no where near done, so many nations are not yet fully making use of stability, decisions etc. This is something we will be working on for next patch."

#kr.political.27.t:0 "Why is my game running so slow?"
#kr.political.27.d:0 "For unknown reasons Hearts of Iron patch 1.5.2 is not playing nice with Kaiserreich 0.6; for many players it is running significantly slower than 1.5.1. We are working with PDX to resolve things, but until then the only solution is to roll back to 1.5.1. This isn't ideal as you naturally miss out the fixes in 1.5.2, but if you game is running too slow for you then that is your only option.\n\nHow do I roll back?\n\n1. Exit the game\n\n2. Right click Hearts of Iron IV in Steam\n\n3. Select Properties\n\n4. Go to the tab called 'BETAS'\n\n5. Select desired patch level in the drop down list\n\n6. Download update"

kr.political.27.t:0 "Kaiserreich and 1.5.3"
kr.political.27.d:0 "With 1.5.3 out, by all accounts PDX has fixed the performance issues we were having with 1.5.2. They have also got in some CTD fixes to boot. We now highly recommend opting out of all betas and running on the normal 1.5.3.\n\nHow do I do that?\n\n1. Exit the game\n\n2. Right click Hearts of Iron IV in Steam\n\n3. Select Properties\n\n4. Go to the tab called 'BETAS'\n\n5. Select 'NONE' in the drop down list\n\n6. Download update"
