 whiteruthenia.1.t:0 "Sigismund makes his move..."
 whiteruthenia.1.d:0 "The Belorussian National Theatre in Minsk is hosting an exceptional performance tonight, as the famous Der Freischütz is on the program. His Majesty Vladimir I, King of White Ruthenia and his entire family are in attendance. His Highness the Prince Sigismund has only reached the building after the third whistle and as he is approaching the entrance..."

 whiteruthenia.1.b:0 "He is arrested by gendarmes as his vile plot is foiled!"
 whiteruthenia.1.c:0 "Sigismund takes his seat and all is well"
 whiteruthenia.2.t:0 "Rethinking our commitment to Germany"
 whiteruthenia.2.d:0 "Sigismund has called a cabinet meeting about our stance on Mitteleuropa. While supporting Germany in their war against Syndicalism is gaining nothing for us, leaving them would remove their much needed protection. Several ministers have proposed that we leave Mitteleurope and try to court the Russians with an alliance while a few others are demanding we become isolationist. What should we do?"
 whiteruthenia.2.a:0 "Contact Voldemaras"
 whiteruthenia.2.b:0 "Try to ally with Russia"

 whiteruthenia.2.e:0 "We need no outside help!"
 whiteruthenia.3.t:0 "An offer from White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.3.d:0 "White Ruthenia has come to us offering a military alliance. While it'd certainly be good to stand with our Slavic brothers, the reaction from Germany would be coarse to say the least. What should we do?"
 whiteruthenia.3.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
 whiteruthenia.3.b:0 "We do not need this"
 whiteruthenia.3.c:0 "A perfect chance to reintegrate White Ruthenia by force!"
 whiteruthenia.4.t:0 "White Ruthenia has left us"
 whiteruthenia.4.d:0 "White Ruthenia has left Mitteleuropa and entered an alliance with the Russians. We however can't risk a war over White Ruthenia regardless of what some officials are calling for."
 whiteruthenia.4.a:0 "Curse them!"
 whiteruthenia.4.b:0 "We shall destroy them!"
 whiteruthenia.5.t:0 "White Ruthenia has left us"
 whiteruthenia.5.d:0 "White Ruthenia has left Mitteleuropa and while White Ruthenia is alone and weak our war against Syndicalism takes first priority. However, several Generals have come forward claiming that we could attack and defeat White Ruthenia in a matter of days but to do so would weaken our forces in the West. What should we do?"
 whiteruthenia.5.a:0 "Leave them alone for now"
 whiteruthenia.5.b:0 "Begin preparations for punitive action!"
 whiteruthenia.6.t:0 "Fall Jungingen"
 whiteruthenia.6.d:0 "With a week having passed since we began preparations for the invasion of White Ruthenia, we are ready as we will ever be. Should we go forward with this?"
 whiteruthenia.6.a:0 "Send in the troops!"
 whiteruthenia.6.b:0 "This was a mistake"
 whiteruthenia.7.t:0 "Sigismund has been Defeated"
 whiteruthenia.7.d:0 "The last troops loyal to Sigismund have been defeated and we now stand in control of White Ruthenia. This is a great day for Germany!"

 whiteruthenia.18.b:0 "Keep the land"
 whiteruthenia.19.t:0 "The fate of White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.19.d:0 "With the end of the war against White Ruthenia, our officials have been discussing what is to be done with the land. It's essentially split between two camps, one wants to give both Lithuania and Poland large amounts of White Ruthenian land as a form of punishment and the other merely wants to reestablish White Ruthenia. What shall we do?"
 whiteruthenia.19.a:0 "Give Poland and Lithuania most of it"
 whiteruthenia.19.b:0 "Offer it to Commonwealth"
 whiteruthenia.19.c:0 "Recreate White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.19.e:0 "Offer it to Russia"
 whiteruthenia.20.t:0 "Germany has given us land"
 whiteruthenia.20.d:0 "With the end of the White Ruthenian war the Germans decided that we are deserving of the Southern White Ruthenian lands. This is a great day for us!"
 whiteruthenia.20.a:0 "We shall put these lands to good use!"
 whiteruthenia.21.t:0 "Germany has given us land"
 whiteruthenia.21.d:0 "With the end of the White Ruthenian war the Germans decided that we are deserving of the Western White Ruthenian lands. This is a great day for us!"

 whiteruthenia.22.t:0 "Germany has given us land"
 whiteruthenia.22.d:0 "With the end of the White Ruthenian war the Germans decided that we are deserving of the Southern and Western White Ruthenian lands. This is a great day for us!"
 whiteruthenia.22.a:0 "We shall put these lands to good use!"
 whiteruthenia.23.t:0 "The remains of White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.23.d:0 "The core area of White Ruthenia now needs to be decided. The majority of our ministers are favoring the creation of a rump White Ruthenia as punishment for their rebellion against us."
 whiteruthenia.23.a:0 "Recreate White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.23.b:0 "Give it to the Commonwealth"
 whiteruthenia.23.c:0 "Offer it to Russia"

 whiteruthenia.25.d:0 "No one should see this.... if someone does.... pls report :P"
 whiteruthenia.25.a:0 "The White Ruthenia is free once more...."
 whiteruthenia.26.t:0 "An offer from Germany"
 whiteruthenia.26.d:0 "White Ruthenia recently had fought and lost a war against Germany after trying to ally with us. Now, Germany is offering us the entire White Ruthenia in return for our continual support of Mitteleuropa. This would strengthen our presence in Europe, and this offer won't cost us too much. Should we accept the German offer?"
 whiteruthenia.26.a:0 "Welcome home Minsk!"
 whiteruthenia.27.t:0 "Russia agreed to our offer"
 whiteruthenia.27.d:0 "Russia has wisely accepted our offer of the remaining lands of White Ruthenia. The trade was worth it as now we have less land to have to worry about."
 whiteruthenia.27.a:0 "Great!"
 whiteruthenia.28.t:0 "Germany grants us control over White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.28.d:0 "While Germany had originally claimed that the future of Minsk and Mogliev needed more consideration, they sent a message declaring those lands to be ours! White Ruthenia is now all in the Commonwealth!"
 whiteruthenia.28.a:0 "The Commonwealth is stronger!"
 whiteruthenia.29.t:0 "A message from White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.29.d:0 "Sigismund, the new King of White Ruthenia has sent us a message expressing his desire to ally with us. While Sigismund is not only a German but also a Hohenzollern means that our policy of anti-Germanism would be questioned. However, we are alone, and it is likely that the Germans will not let us be free peacefully, and any allies are better than none. What should we do?"
 whiteruthenia.29.a:0 "Ally with White Ruthenia"
 whiteruthenia.29.b:0 "No, they are no help!"
 whiteruthenia.36.t:0 "Nationalism in the East"
 whiteruthenia.36.d:0 "Horrible news! With in two days Nationalists in both Lithuania and White Ruthenia have seized their governments and left Mitteleuropa! To matter matters even worse they have allied with each other, clearly against us. With the possibility of several long conflicts to reestablish control over the East, it is not likely the German people will be supportive of any military action. What should we do?"
 whiteruthenia.36.a:0 "Destroy them!"
 whiteruthenia.36.b:0 "We cannot intervene"
 whiteruthenia.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits White Ruthenia!"
 whiteruthenia.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached White Ruthenia. German-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the White Ruthenian rubel is losing value, and agricultural exports are shrinking..."
 whiteruthenia.30.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."
 whiteruthenia.31.t:0 "Ostwall fortification program"
 whiteruthenia.31.d:0 "With Russian armed forces emerging from previous years of neglect as fearsome force it is high time for us to improve our weak border defences. Our top military leaders propose to solve this situation via improving existing net of fortifications along borders with Russia, known as Ostwall. Once finished, such massive fortifications will surely stop any kind of Russian assault."
 whiteruthenia.31.a:0 "Launch Ostwall fortification program!"
 whiteruthenia.31.b:0 "This is not needed..."
 whiteruthenia.32.t:0 "Improving Ostwall"
 whiteruthenia.32.d:0 "Our dilligent engineers and soldiers have completed another part of fortification line along borders of White Ruthenia with Russia. Shall we continue with its expansion or are such fortifications sufficient?"
 whiteruthenia.32.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"
 whiteruthenia.32.b:0 "This is not needed..."
 whiteruthenia.33.t:0 "Improving Ostwall"
 whiteruthenia.33.d:0 "Our dilligent engineers and soldiers have completed another part of fortification line along borders of White Ruthenia with Russia. Shall we continue with its expansion or are such fortifications sufficient?"
 whiteruthenia.33.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"
 whiteruthenia.33.b:0 "This is not needed..."
 whiteruthenia.34.t:0 "Improving Ostwall"
 whiteruthenia.34.d:0 "Our dilligent engineers and soldiers have completed another part of fortification line along borders of White Ruthenia with Russia. Shall we continue with its expansion or are such fortifications sufficient?"
 whiteruthenia.34.a:0 "Further improve our defences!"
 whiteruthenia.34.b:0 "This is not needed..."
 whiteruthenia.35.t:0 "Ostwall fortification program completed"
 whiteruthenia.35.d:0 "Our dilligent engineers and soldiers have completed fortification line along borders of White Ruthenia with Russia. With such protections in place, our independence is secured."
 whiteruthenia.35.a:0 "Excellent!"
