  amcivwar.71.d:0 "The war between the CSA and PSA had torn the country apart and it was still raging. Some in the CSA believed that peace with the Pacific States would be better than continuing the disastrous war. Some were wary of this approach as the resources of the PSA were in great need but an end to the conflict would relieve the pressure on the workers."
  amcivwar.71.a:0 "Go ahead with the conference."
  amcivwar.71.b:0 "We don't need to negotiate"
  amcivwar.72.t:0 "The St. Louis Conference"
  amcivwar.72.d:0 "Reed had extended an invitation to the leadership of the PSA to come to St. Louis to discuss peace. By accepting the invitation the PSA could negotiate a peace that allow the PSA to remain independent but some in the PSA would like to see the CSA defeated so it could set its own terms."

  amcivwar.82.t:0 "The Conscription Act"
  amcivwar.82.d:0 "The strong military tradition of the south was not to be understated but the lack of manpower was an issue for the AUS. By reducing the age of conscription to 15 the American Union State was able to gain more manpower."

  amcivwar.84.d:0 "The capture of Atlanta by enemy forces have forced Long and his men to look to Reed and the CSA for help. Reed and the CSA were not in very good shape either as they were losing the war as well and Long seriously considered making a deal with the devil."
  amcivwar.84.a:0 "We have no choice."
  amcivwar.84.b:0 "No deals with Reed."
  amcivwar.85.t:0 "Deal With the Devil"
  amcivwar.85.d:0 "With the defeat of the AUS imminent, Long had sent an envoy to Reed's camp to discuss the possibilities of an alliance. Trusting Long would be foolish but as Reed's position was not as strong as it could be and an alliance would help the war effort."
  amcivwar.85.a:0 "No deals with Long"

  amcivwar.86.t:0 "Deal With the Devil signed"
  amcivwar.86.d:0 "With the defeat of the AUS imminent, Long had sent an envoy to Reed's camp to discuss the possibilities of an alliance. After much debate Reed and the CSA leadership agreed and an alliance between the CSA and the AUS was formed."

  amcivwar.88.t:0 "Dixie Metal"
  amcivwar.88.d:0 "The war was hard on the American Union State as it had less resources than the other powers. The people of the AUS rallied and began handing in pots and pans to be melted to support the war effort. This increased the metal supply in the American Union State."
  amcivwar.88.a:0 "That is Southern spirit"
  amcivwar.89.t:0 "Untapped Oil Reserves"
  amcivwar.89.d:0 "The AUS desperately needed oil for its airforce and the government scavenged the fledgling country for any oil that it could find. After an exhaustive search several hundred barrels were gathered and handed over to the airforce."

  amcivwar.90.t:0 "War Bonds"
  amcivwar.90.d:0 "The state needed to pay for the war and looked to its citizens to buy war bonds to support the government. People began spending what meager amounts of money they had to support the war effort."

  amcivwar.91.t:0 "Coloured Units"
  amcivwar.91.d:0 "The racial tensions of the south did not mean that some African-Americans didn't decide to fight for the American Union State.

The American Union forces could use the extra manpower but there was a fear that this could lead to racial tensions."

  amcivwar.148.a:0 "Welcome to the PSA"
  amcivwar.149.t:0 "Petitioning the Entente"
  amcivwar.149.d:0 "The defeat of the Pacific States of America and United States of America at the hands of the CSA had left the islands of Hawaii with no allies and an uncertain future. The Entente appeared to be the natural choice to ally with against the CSA but people in Hawaii were worried that this could draw the islands into a war. Opinion was split on the islands."
  amcivwar.149.a:0 "Send the request"
  amcivwar.149.b:0 "We will stay on our own"
  amcivwar.150.t:0 "Hawaii Requests Entry into the Entente"
  amcivwar.150.d:0 "Hawaii has requested entry into the Entente. The strategic position of Hawaii makes them a valuable member for the Entente. There was concern that if Hawaii was added to the Entente, it would change the balance of power in the Pacific."
  amcivwar.150.a:0 "A welcome addition"
  amcivwar.150.b:0 "We should avoid a provocative move"
  amcivwar.151.t:0 "Hawaii Joins the Entente"

  amcivwar.152.a:0 "Damn"
  amcivwar.153.t:0 "Expansion of Hawaii's Industry"
  amcivwar.153.d:0 "The usual distribution of Hawaii's pineapples had been disrupted due to the American Civil War but the demand for them had not. Dole had emphasized the need to strengthen Hawaii's economy and expand it's industry. The pineapple companies of the islands began increasing production and building more facilities for the increased production."
  amcivwar.153.a:0 "Behold our pineapples!"
  amcivwar.154.t:0 "Resource Expansion"
  amcivwar.154.d:0 "The necessity for Hawaii to expand it's resources as well as its industry has prompted a scouring of the islands for any natural resources that could be found."
  amcivwar.154.a:0 "More fuel for the pineapple factories!"
  amcivwar.155.t:0 "Pineapple Workers Union"
  amcivwar.155.d:0 "The expansion of the industry in Hawaii had come with a cost to the labourers. Long hours and low wages had made the workers in the fields discontent and there was talk of a union. Union activists took to the streets of Honolulu to get their demands heard."
  amcivwar.155.a:0 "We will make reforms"
  amcivwar.155.b:0 "This system works fine"
  amcivwar.156.t:0 "Island Agitators"
  amcivwar.156.d:0 "The CSA's extensive network of spies had led to their learning of the labour issues that were cropping up on the islands in Hawaii. The islands were not part of the CSA's overall strategy as seizing the islands would make the CSA no better than any other imperialist, but the plight of the workers was in the best interest of the CSA and if it happened to ensure the Hawaii islands came under the control of the CSA then so be it."
  amcivwar.156.a:0 "Send in some men to support the workers."
  amcivwar.156.b:0 "Forget Hawaii. We need to finish America."
  amcivwar.157.t:0 "The Red Pineapple Riot"
  amcivwar.157.d:0 "The arrival of CSA agitators had encited the workers of Hawaii into a near frenzy. Protests were launched across the islands. When the police attempted to control the protest they were pelted with pineapples that had been painted red. Several policemen were injured and the crowd effectively dispersed but the riot had seriously shaken the local authorities."
  amcivwar.157.a:0 "We must reform."
  amcivwar.157.b:0 "Arresting the CSA agitators should do it."
  amcivwar.158.t:0 "Trade Union of Hawaii"
  amcivwar.158.d:0 "The Trade Union of Hawaii had been slowly gaining power since the Hawaiian government had instituted reforms. The CSA government was divided as to whether this was enough or not. Many believed that the islands should be forced to adopt the ideals of the CSA but there are many who see the islands as making a natural progression to Syndicalism."
  amcivwar.158.a:0 "Demand Hawaii reforms"
  amcivwar.158.b:0 "Let their revolution evolve"
  amcivwar.159.t:0 "Trade Union of Hawaii"
  amcivwar.159.d:0 "Since the reforms on the island the trade unionists have been gianing more and more power. The CSA had been assisting in the organization of the unions and had been pressuring the Hawaii government for more reforms. The reforms that were proposed would make the islands a virtual puppet of the CSA and the people were very resistant to the idea but many saw that the islands had very little choice."
  amcivwar.159.a:0 "Bow to the CSA reforms"
  amcivwar.159.b:0 "We will make reforms for the people, not the CSA"
  amcivwar.159.c:0 "We will never submit to the CSA"
  amcivwar.160.t:0 "Hawaii Becomes a CSA Protectorate"
  amcivwar.160.d:0 "Hawaii has allowed the CSA government control of its policies to ensure the fair treatment of the workers there. CSA officials are already on their way to the island to take control of the government."
  amcivwar.160.a:0 "Forward the revolution!"
  amcivwar.161.t:0 "Hawaii Refuses CSA Help"
  amcivwar.161.d:0 "The islands of Hawaii have refused to allow the CSA to mediate the labour issues on the island. They have refused to listen to the issues of the workers and have threatened the CSA representatives that have been sent there. The people are crying out for the government to take action to support the workers in Hawaii but some are also skeptical about how well the government could persecute a war against such a distant target."
  amcivwar.161.a:0 "War for the workers!"
  amcivwar.161.b:0 "Peace will work better"
  amcivwar.162.t:0 "The rise of Native Nationalism"
  amcivwar.162.d:0 "With our nation having been free for some time now, the natives have organised a movement for the restoration of the Hawaiian monarchy. While this would normally be a source of great concern, considering the deposed family has married into the industrial families, a restoration would be benefical... The current pretender to the throne, Edward D. Kawananakoa, would be easy to control. A monrachy would expand our nation's cultural independence, and give the populace a figurehead..."
  amcivwar.162.a:0 "Restore the monarchy!"
  amcivwar.162.b:0 "Who's in control here?"
  amcivwar.163.t:0 "Rebellion in Hawaii"

  amcivwar.164.t:0 "The fate of Puerto Rico"
  amcivwar.164.d:0 "With the East Coast and the Panama Canal out of our control, we must decide on the fate of Puerto Rico. The most reasonable option is to give to the Entante, but it is feared that such an act will cause additional dissent in our already deperate population."
  amcivwar.164.a:0 "Give it to the Entente"
  amcivwar.164.b:0 "Fortify the island"
  amcivwar.165.t:0 "Puerto Rico given to the Entente"
  amcivwar.165.d:0 "The US government has decided to give us the island of Puerto Rico. There is talk among our military that the island provides a perfect position for our fleet to operate in the Southern Atlantic. Still, others believe it should belong to our Carribean friends."
