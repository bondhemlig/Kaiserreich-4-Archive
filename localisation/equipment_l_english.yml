The first vehicle was to be armed with anti-tank gun and two machine guns and the second one was to be a support vehicle armed with a larger calibre gun. The first one eventually became known as Panzerkampfwagen III, which was to be a standard tank for the three light companies of a tank battalion. The second one became known as Panzerkampfwagen IV."

 #GER_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed as an infantry-support tank, the Panzer IV was not originally intended to engage enemy armour - that function was performed by the lighter Panzer III. However, with the flaws of pre-war doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of Soviet T-34 tanks, the Panzer IV soon assumed the tanks-fighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin. The most widely manufactured and deployed German tanks of the Second Weltkrieg, the Panzer IV was used as the base for many other fighting vehicles."

It was intended as a counter to the Russian T-34, and as a replacement for the Panzer III and Panzer IV. While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tank until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tank of the Second Weltkrieg."

They fought in Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge and on the Eastern Front. They were very successful tank destroyers but performed badly when used out of role as substitutes for tanks or assault guns, as most tank destroyers were. In the later stages of the war however, they were increasingly used as tank substitutes, because there was often nothing else available."

 #GER_medium_tank_destroyer_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Jagdpanther (German: 'hunting panther') was a tank destroyer built by Germany during the Second Weltkrieg based on the chassis of the Panther. It entered service late in the war (1944) and saw service on the Eastern and Western fronts. The Jagdpanther combined the very powerful 8.8 cm PaK 43 cannon of the Tiger II and the characteristically excellent armour and suspension of the Panther chassis, although it suffered from the general poor state of Germany in the later part of the war, which resulted in small production numbers, shortage in spare parts and poor crew training."

 #GER_medium_tank_aa_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Flakpanzer IV 'Ostwind' (German: 'East Wind') was a self-propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier Flakpanzer IV. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, hexagonal turret which housed a 3.7 cm FlaK 43. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the gun."

 #GER_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Known under the informal name Königstiger but, often semi-literally translated as the King Tiger by Allied soldiers, the design followed the same concept as the Tiger I, but was intended to be even more formidable. The Tiger II combined the thick armour of the Tiger I with the sloped armour used on the Panther medium tank. The tank weighed almost seventy metric tons, was protected by 100 to 180mm of armour to the front and was armed with the long barrelled 8.8 cm Kampfwagenkanone 43 L/71 gun."

 IRE_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named after the revolutionary leader Patrick Pearse, who died in the Easter Rising of 1916. The Pearse I was the first real Irish attempt at producing their own line of armor, and owed much to the German WK1 tanks delivered to them during peace time. "
 IRE_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "Wolfe ILA-36"
 IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Wolfe L-36"
 IRE_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Wolfe light tank was designed in 1936 as a considerable upgrade to the previous Pearse tank built in '34. Named after the father of Irish republicanism, Wolfe Tone, the Wolfe was a quick and nimble tank that packed a punch despite it's size."

 IRE_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "Emmet ILA-41"
 IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Emmet L-41"
 IRE_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Produced in 1941, the Emmet light tank was the final Irish effort to produce a modern light tank for use in WK2. Faster than the prior two iterations and better armoured, it lacked the punching power of the heavier Collins or Savage models, but made up for it by being cheaper to produce and more flexible."
 IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "O'Connell IMA-39"
 IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "O'Connell M-39"
 IRE_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The O'Connell IMA-39 was the first in a new series of medium tank designs created by the Irish Republican Army. Much more heavily armored than the lighter designs and with more firepower, the IMA-39 was still a highly mobile tank. Irish tanks were reknown for being highly cost-effective, and the O'Connell continued this trend."

 IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Affectionately nicknamed a 'big clunky bastard' by General Richard Mulcahy, the 1934 produced heavy tank Fionn was Ireland's first real foray into the post-GW heavy tank era. As it's nickname suggested, it had woeful reliability scores, but it did later prove to have some use during WK2."
 IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2:0 "Savage IHA-41"
 IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Savage H-41"
 IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The aptly named Savage was one of the most advanced tank designs produced and tested by Ireland during WK2. Few were made due to their prohibitive industrial cost, but the Savage packed a ferocious punch and was known for it's high reliability despite being a heavy tank design."

 IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3:0 "Cormac IHA-43"
 IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Cormac H-43"
 IRE_heavy_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "Ireland's final pre-modern iteration of the heavy battle tank, the Cormac offered superior protection and firepower to the Savage but struggled to hold it's own weight, and regularly encountered engine problems. Very few were built, and they were viewed as 'smoldering death traps' more often than not by Irish tankers."

 IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1:0 "Lugh ISHA-43"
 IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Lugh SH-43"
 IRE_super_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Named after a legendary Irish hero, the Lugh was a new generation of super-heavy battle tank theorised towards the end of WK2. Only a few models ever saw production due to the massive cost it took to produce them, but it is unlikely that the Cormac would ever have seen widespread use in battle even if it had come earlier in the war. Like many super-heavy tanks, it was simply too unreliable."
 IRE_modern_tank_equipment_1:0 "Morrigan IMBT-45"
 IRE_modern_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Morrigan BT-45"
 IRE_modern_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "With the production of the Morrigan main battle tank, Ireland left the WK2 era of tanks behind and began production of the so-called modern tank, a mobile weapons platform that offered all of the advantages of older tank designs but built with performance and flexibility in mind."

The British prefer to call them "tanks", a name adopted during the early stages of their development as a security measure to conceal their purpose, while the German counterpart, "Panzer", stuck in many German-influenced nations. Early tanks were armed with machineguns and small cannons, moved slowly, and were armoured only enough to stop small arms fire."

SIA_light_cruiser_3:0 "Naresuan Class"
SIA_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Naresuan class consisted of a pair of light cruisers built in Italy. They were launched in 1941 but were requisitioned by the Siamese navy in 1942. They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
SIA_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Sri Ayudhaya Class"
SIA_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Sri Ayudhaya class coastal defence ships were perhaps the last ships of this type built in the world, with both ships of the class built in Japan and commissioned for the Royal Siamese Navy in 1938. The design was comparable to a small cruiser (or large destroyer) in size, to a battleship in speed, and to a heavy cruiser in armament. Its main guns were four 203mm/53 3-Shiki cannon. They were lightly armored compared to contemporary heavy cruisers."
