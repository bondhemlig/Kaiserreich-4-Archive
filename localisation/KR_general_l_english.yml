 ### Name and Description
 KR_SCENARIO_NAME:0 "Legacy of the Weltkrieg"
 KR_SCENARIO_DESC:0 "The year of 1936 is a turning point for the history of the world. A time of both great opportunity and great danger. Tensions between the German Empire and the Commune of France are growing, Russia and the USA are increasingly unstable and the old empires of Austria and Ottomans are dissolving. All the meanwhile Syndicalism, Totalism and Radical Socialism are spreading all around the world. Fifteen years have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg, and the old rivalries of yore have reappeared. A single spark may be all it takes to light the powder keg..."
 
 ### Germany
 GER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919, after five years of war, the German army finally overran the Entente defences in France. In 1921, Britain's surrender followed. The Weltkrieg has made Germany an uncontested World Power, yet things have been going downhill for her since the 1930s. A recessive world economy has dampened the nation's industrial output while other nations' manufacturing power recovers, and now nationalism grows in Germany's eastern client states, who are starting to drift away from the Reich. In 1936, Germany stands at a crossroads, and already we can see cracks in her mighty empire, as her ancestral enemies are regaining their former strength..."
 
 ### Austria
 AUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While the Weltkrieg revealed Austria's weakness and dependence on the Germans, it was the 20s that definitively ended her dreams of power. After Emperor Karl died in 1922, the throne passed to his 10-year-old son Otto. Soon after, the Austrian industrial economy collapsed due to competition from German manufacturers. Finally, the need for German mediation to resolve the deadlock of the Ausgleich negotiations in 1927, resulted in autonomy statutes for Bohemia and Galicia. However, Otto has now come of age and the terms of the Ausgleich are to be renegotiated next year. This may be the time for Austria to reassert her power..."
 
 ### Commune of France
 FRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The 3rd Republic ended in the way it began: defeated by German arms, and facing Revolution at home. In 1919, a General Strike was called by the CGT, causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. For 15 years, the new 'Commune of France' has united behind a common platform of Syndico-Socialist consensus, headed by the Comité de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the need to rebuild the country and defend the revolution is believed to be outdated by many critics and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is confident in her mission, but it is unclear which revolutionary strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."
 
 ### Union of Britain
 ENG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After 1921's 'Peace with Honour' ended the Weltkrieg, the faith and support of the people in the Home Islands had disappeared. In 1925, disaster struck: a minor labour dispute quickly escalated into a General Strike called by the TUC, followed by military desertions to the strikers. After six weeks of rioting on a massive scale, the Royal Family and most of the country's elites were evacuated to Canada and instead, a new Congress of Trade Unions assumed political authority. The British people are currently content to build socialism in isolation, yet many are starting to think that the Monarchists in Canada cannot be allowed to plot against the Union indefinitely..."
 
 ### Canada
 CAN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the Revolution of 1925, the Royal Family and other British exiles found refuge in Canada. With the support of the Conservatives, they established a semi-official government in exile, in hopes of one day reclaiming the Home Islands. All is not well, however. RB Bennett's conservatives lost the 1935 election to Mackenzie King's Liberals, who, with a loose coalition of 'Progressives', now hold a slim majority in parliament and seek to assert Canadian parliamentary sovereignty against the growing power of the British Exiles and Crown. With the global political situation deteriorating, the stage is set for intense conflict both at home and abroad..."
 
 ### Russia
 RUS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "During Russia's Civil War, the White forces fought with all they had, but the Red Army still dominated the country's industrial heartland. The German empire however, fearing a red Russia, decided to intervene on behalf of the Whites. Two years later, Moscow and Petrograd fell to the White forces, and a new Russian Republic was established. For the past fifteen years, the leading parties, S-R and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition under Kerensky, but Russia is becoming increasingly unstable. Other political forces are growing, and they are considering that it is now time for change, so that the country may reassert her power in the world..."
 
 ### United States
 USA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The USA almost left their policy of isolation to intervene in the Weltkrieg, but ultimately kept out of the war. This lead to a victory of the Central Powers. Since then, the USA has struggled economically, European trade opportunities, and the repayment of their loans to the Entente have been made impossible by a German victory. Still internationally regarded as a 'nobody', she now faces mounting internal dissent as the Republican-Democratic hegemony is challenged by two groups - the Syndicalists and the America First Union. With a mounting crisis at home and only a modest reputation overseas, things aren't looking good for the United States of America..."
 
 ### Federation of Italy
 ITA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In 1919 Italy collapsed under a Central Powers' offensive, and the combination of anger at Italy's betrayal and the Austrian desire for a divided Italian peninsula led to a federation of autonomous duchies nominally headed by the Pope being established. A group of radical cardinals, aided by Pope Pius XI, has recently pushed for the centralisation and expansion of Papal power and control over the federation. However, the Holy See must face up to several challenges to its new power - ranging from the now demonised Syndicalist regimes to the south and west of the Federation, to the now very upset Austrians to the north..."
 
 ### National France
 NFA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Fleeing the new Commune of France, the whole apparatus of state and French military, embarked with the Navy to Algiers in 1919. Here, the politicians decided to start from scratch again, and thus proclaiming the Fourth Republic in exile but while still claiming the motherland and still allied with the British. Soon, with most of the refugees being either nationalist, authoritarian, or both, the military seized power under the leadership of Ferdinand Foch followed by the victor of Verdun, Philippe Pétain. Will National France be ready to retake the motherland despite the discontentment of the natives - maybe helped by the young guard of de Gaulle..."
 
 ### Japan
 JAP_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "While the 'Peace with Honour' guaranteed Japanese rule over the colonies, not all was well in the Empire of the Rising Sun. After a period of economic upheaval culminated in a Syndicalist attempt on the life of Regent Hirohito, unstable governments followed one another in the crisis year of 1926; First General Tanaka, then the democratic Coalition Cabinet as the military strengthened its position by disobeying orders and occupying Manchuria. In 1936, Japan is poised to extend her empire. With Germany's dominance appearing to be in decline, the Japanese look hungrily at the remaining Qing territories and the German pacific possessions..."
 
 ### Ottoman Empire
 OTT_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Ottoman Army had begun to collapse by 1918 and seemed likely to surrender. With the fall of France however, Germany was finally free to send troops to the collapsing Ottoman fronts. The British were quickly driven out of Baghdad and Jerusalem, and the Central Powers soon reached the Suez Canal. Ever triumphant, the Ottomans gained Cyprus and a set of puppet governments in the peace of 1921; but still the Empire remained unindustrialised and in desperate need of reform. However, all is not yet lost, the political situation in Europe is rapidly changing, and many opportunities beckon. Will the 'Sick man of Europe' finally recover?"
 
 ### Netherlands
 HOL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "While preserving neutrality in Europe, the Netherlands faced all the fiercer challenges in their colonies. The Indonesian Independence movement grows bolder by the day, and the grand days of the Dutch Navy are long gone. And even in Europe, things could be better; the Netherlands have always had a special relationship with Germany, particularly economically – which means the rising economic problems in Germany could extend to the Low Countries. And all of this comes at a time in which a rising number of the Dutch people falter over French syndicalism or the dreams of a Greater Netherlands..."
 
 ### Mexico
 MEX_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Mexico has been reigned over by a coalition of former enemies, Alvaro Obregon and Emiliano Zapata, for the last years. Obregon initiated major reconstructions plans to alleviate the damage of the civil war, while Zapatas land reform redistributed nearly 45 million acres of arable land to the peasantry. Zapata was then elected president in 1932, but despite his great progress so far, the next presidential election remains a mystery. Pancho Villa, supported by Zapata, is the favourite, but the Totalist Plutarco Calles may cause some surprises. And while the question of socialisation of foreign ownership remains, the USA have been plunged into turmoil..."
 
 ### Delhi
 DEH_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Too little and too late, the Anglo-Indian Treaty of 1925 could not bind the Jewel to the Empire. After the Revolution in the homelands, the leadership of the Indian National Congress convened a provisional government in Calcutta. In the confusion of the ensuing civil war, the southern princes rebelled from the Delhi government, prolonging the civil war until 1928. The uneasy truce between the three Indias – the Syndicalist Bharatiyan Commune, the Princely federation in the South and the Entente-loyal Delhi government - has held since then, but all three seem to be gathering steam for a new round of conflict over the legacy of the late British Raj..."
 
 ### Brazil
 BRA_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Brazil's fragile First Republic has been on the brink of death since the humiliating defeat by Argentina last year. The Brazilian Workers Confederation, an umbrella organisation for the Syndicalists, is leading heavy labour strikes in the Southeast. Meanwhile, nationalist thoughts are growing popular among the middle class. Not even the armed forces can be trusted anymore: the 'Tenentes', the group of officers that already organised mutinies during the war, could be mobilized by any side of the political spectrum. Emergency elections have been called for August, and some say that only a miracle can save democracy in Brazil..."
 
 ### Romanian
 ROM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After Romania was defeated in the Weltkrieg, the country was forced to sign the Treaty of Bucharest in 1918. The southern part of Dobrogea was returned to Bulgaria, Oltenia was de-militarized, and the oilfields were leased to Germany until 2018. When the king died after the war, the military took over the country. Eventually their collaboration with far-right parties would result in the violent take-over of the nationalist Iron Guard in 1935. Lead by the charismatic Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, the new government looks to restore Romania to its former greatness, while also having to deal with the supporters of the monarchy, who want to oust the new regime..."
 
 ### History
 OTHER_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are waiting for their turn to rise as a major player of this world. From major powers trying to keep their empires to the many nations trying to regain what they lost in the Weltkrieg, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world..."
