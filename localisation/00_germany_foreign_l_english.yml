GER_BUR_ALLY:0 "Invite Burma"
GER_BUR_ALLY_desc:0 "The recent invitation of Siam into the Japanese Co-propserity sphere poses a threat to our large Pacific colonial empire. We can try to counter expansion of Japanese influence through Indochina by allying with Burma, a state threatened from one side by syndicalists and from another by the expansionist Siam. This way we can threaten Siam from the west should a conflict arise."
