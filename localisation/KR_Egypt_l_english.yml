### Focus Tree ###
EGY_Sultanate:0 "Royal House's New Year Decree"
EGY_Sultanate_desc:0 "1936 dawns, and with it comes the start of a new era for our nation. We have been cruelly denied our rightful place as masters of the Levant for far too long, but with the Arab Congress we finally have our chance to right this injustice once and for all!"
EGY_Heritage1:0 "Safeguard our Heritage"
EGY_Heritage1_desc:0 "Our Great Country has had a long and bountiful history full of persons and actions of note. We should seek to safeguard these artifacts for future generations to appreciate, so long as they pay."
EGY_Heritage2:0 "Safeguard the Pyramids"
EGY_Heritage2_desc:0 "The Great Pyramids have proven a popular attraction to European nationals ever since their discovery, we should implement a new tax on these visitors to raise much needed income."
EGY_Heritage3:0 "Encourage Austrian Tourism"
EGY_Heritage3_desc:0 "Our Great Nation has a long and storied friendship with the Austrian Empire and it's Hapsburg monarchs. With international tensions limiting tours from other nations we should seek to encourage more Austrian tourists and Egyptologists and prosper from our mutual friendship through new visa policies."
EGY_Heritage4:0 "Open the Valley of the Kings"
EGY_Heritage4_desc:0 "The Valley of the Kings currently lays dormant near Luxor as little more than a quiet research site. We should open it up to certain Esteemed guests and foreign scholars - for a small fee of course."
EGY_Heritage5:0 "Open the Tombs"
EGY_Heritage5_desc:0 "Long have we been aware of Tombs laying undisturbed under our Golden Sands. We will open these Tombs and rediscover Exotic treasures to attract even the most cynical tourist."
EGY_Cotton1:0 "Black Monday strikes Egypt!"
EGY_Cotton1_desc:0 "Our Economy has been thrown into crisis thanks to the German economic meltdown and its impact on foreign investment and Suez traffic. We must formulate a plan to help protect and revive our crippled economy before it is too late."
EGY_Cotton2:0 "Crisis Measures"
EGY_Cotton2_desc:0 "For now we must move to secure all holdings within the Sultanate, both personal and private. With these stopgap measures in place we can then build on them further."
EGY_Cotton3:0 "Secure the Cotton Fields"
EGY_Cotton3_desc:0 "The uneducated farmers and smallholders move to burn their cotton crop and sow anew. We must prevent their shortsighted measures and enacts reforms to agricultural practice so that we still have Cotton to export when the crisis ebbs."
EGY_Cotton4:0 "Subsidise the Cotton Pickers"
EGY_Cotton4_desc:0 "Words might fail to persuade them, but cold hard cash won't. If we can ensure that our agricultural sector is protected through a massive loans programme, we will be ready to help make uniforms for rapidly expanding European armies."
EGY_Cotton5:0 "Reopen the Stock Markets"
EGY_Cotton5_desc:0 "Our Measures have stabilised the Economy but not fully reclaimed it from the abyss. By reopening the stock markets we should give the free market impetus to pick up the slack and signal to foreign investors our return to fiscal vigour."
EGY_Cotton6:0 "The Crisis Ends"
EGY_Cotton6_desc:0 "Our strong mix of state intervention and free market support has been just enough to return the cotton prices to Pre-Crisis levels. With this we now have room to focus on other sectors including ones necessary for our military expansion."

EGY_Oil3:0 "Further Oil Struck!"
EGY_Oil3_desc:0 "A smaller oil deposit has also been found within the harsh wastes of the Western Desert. No matter its size we should still well and harvest it. After all, every little helps."
EGY_Civ1:0 "Civillian Investment Fund"
EGY_Civ1_desc:0 "While supporting looms and baskets certainly won't win a war, supporting these ventures will win us the thanks of our people and strengthen our domestic position at a time of great uncertainty."
EGY_Civ2:0 "Expand the Domestic Industries"
EGY_Civ2_desc:0 "Further expansion of domestic industries will prove valuble in supporting our proud nation. After all, we cannot leave the Egyptian people behind in our efforts to expand the Sultanate."
EGY_Civ3:0 "Infrastructure Improvements"
EGY_Civ3_desc:0 "How can we aspire to be Master of the Levant when we cannot even build a railroad? For too long smug Europeans have had a monopoly on large-scale infrastructure projects with the aim of enriching themselves. This state of affairs must end."
EGY_Mil1:0 "Military Investment Zones"
EGY_Mil1_desc:0 "We still lack the heavy industry needed to support our ambitions for regional supremacy. By encouraging and investing in the creation of military-industrial zones in our major cities we can help to address this problem."
EGY_Mil2:0 "Found the Cairo Institute of Arms"
EGY_Mil2_desc:0 "Our exploratory investments appear to have borne fruit. A group of foreign investors are keen to open an Institute of Arms in Cairo to manufacture weapons en-masse. We should provide them with all the capital we can in order to support the enterprise."

EGY_Army2:0 "Expand the Royal Army"
EGY_Army2_desc:0 "The Sultan demands his forces be expanded at once, we cannot issue bellicose threats without the men to back them up after all. All of our rivals shall fear us."
EGY_Motor1:0 "Motorisation Efforts"
EGY_Motor1_desc:0 "While our camel regiments still have their place due to the harsh sands, motorised divisions are the way of the future! We should start to expand our stock of vehicles, incorporating them into our forces."
EGY_Motor2:0 "Armour Program"
EGY_Motor2_desc:0 "When the British abandoned the Suez during the Revolution they left behind a number of tanks in their hasty evacuation. While now somewhat obsolete, aspects of their design are still useful for research purposes and to help us begin a wider Armour program."
EGY_Nco1:0 "Approach Retired Officers"
EGY_Nco1_desc:0 "When the British left our country, they did not take all of their ilk with them. Some soldiers and officers decided to retire as they had grown accustomed to - and enjoy - life in Egypt. We should attempt to entice some of these men into our active service. Their experience in the Weltkrieg would prove invaluable in overhauling our forces."
EGY_Nco2:0 "Overtures to the German NCO's"
EGY_Nco2_desc:0 "Our agents within the Suez Force have reported dissatisfaction amongst some of the more belligerent members of the force.

EGY_Art1:0 "Retire the Weltkrieg Pieces"
EGY_Art1_desc:0 "While they have served us well in recent years it is indisputably time to modernise our artillery contingents. Modern technological developments in the field and increased adaptation to the climate by newer pieces should serve us well."

EGY_Army3_desc:0 "With huge strides made in administrative reform, weaponry and training we are now truly capable of calling our army a professional fighting force."
EGY_Navy1:0 "Found the Naval Academy of Alexandria"
EGY_Navy1_desc:0 "While we acquired a large number of ships after the Weltkrieg we still lack the talented crew and officers necessary to man them. Founding a formal Naval Academy with royal patronage as in the old British tradition would be a good first step in solving this problem."
EGY_Navy2:0 "Rethink the Doctrines of Old"
EGY_Navy2_desc:0 "Our naval strategic planning has a distinctly 19th century quality to it. In response, the Sultan demands his admirals formulate a new naval policy for upcoming wars. The Admirality will begin with haste to formulate doctrines suitable for the modern age."
EGY_Navy3:0 "Alexandrian Dockyards"
EGY_Navy3_desc:0 "No longer can we sit idle with our second-hand ships and woeful shipyards. We must begin the manufacture of new ships while we still have chance to catch-up with the world, and that means improving our dockyards in Alexandria."
EGY_Navy4:0 "Fit For A Sultan"
EGY_Navy4_desc:0 "Our Sultan demands a fleet capable not only of rivalling the Eternal Turk, but one that can stand against potential European enemies in the Mediterranean. Our shipwrights have taken note and are designing a new range of battleships and cruisers."
EGY_Navy5:0 "Egyptian Marine Force"
EGY_Navy5_desc:0 "Maritime dominance relies not only on who has the larger fleet but also who can capitalise on the other's mistakes. We must commission an amphibious assault force that can strike fast against our foes' virtually undefended coastlines."
EGY_Camel1:0 "Royal Camel Corps"
EGY_Camel1_desc:0 "The wars of the future shall be fought across the harsh deserts of the Sinai and the Hamad. We should seek to expand our camel forces in order to adapt our forces more effectively to this environment."

EGY_Morale1_desc:0 "All of our soldiers fight under one banner, one nation, and for one people. For we are all the sons of Egypt, and we shall fight to the last man to defend her sands!"
EGY_Airforce1:0 "Royal Egyptian Air Force"
EGY_Airforce1_desc:0 "To match our strong land and sea contingents, we must also compete in the skies! New fighter designs will be ordered and placed into production to meet this need."
EGY_Airforce2:0 "Fighter Wings"
EGY_Airforce2_desc:0 "The first step to aerial domination is to have the tools needed to fight a modern air war, namely air superiority fighters. We must begin researching new fighter designs if we are to keep up with our enemies."
EGY_Airforce3:0 "Bomber Wings"
EGY_Airforce3_desc:0 "Destruction from the skies is a key part of modern warfare and we will adapt and respond accordingly."
EGY_Airforce4:0 "Aerial Tactics"
EGY_Airforce4_desc:0 "Gallant biplane duels are a thing of the past and our doctrines must be adapted accordingly. Aerial dogfighting is no longer a chivalrous affair and our pilots will be made to recognise this."
EGY_Airforce5:0 "Aerial Rebasing"
EGY_Airforce5_desc:0 "We currently lack an adequate number of airfields to support our growing air force, and the bases we have do not allow us to properly protect even our territory. We must construct new bases as soon as we are able!"

EGY_Arab1_desc:0 "Our grand Arab Congress will be an event that lives on forever in the annals of history, in both East and West. It will be where the proud Arab people finally seized their destiny once more!"

EGY_Arab3:0 "The Axis Triumphant"
EGY_Arab3_desc:0 "The Axis stands strong and proud after our victory against the Eternal Turk! We shall stage a victory parade in Cairo to demonstrate to the world we are now united as the pre-eminent power in the Middle East!"
EGY_Arab4:0 "African Ambitions"
EGY_Arab4_desc:0 "While we might now be Masters of the Levant we have yet to properly flex our geopolitical muscle elsewhere. We should evaluate what actions we can take to extend our influence south of the Cataracts."
EGY_Arab5:0 "Secure the Gulf"
EGY_Arab5_desc:0 "The gulf belongs to the Axis and nobody else! If Oman and Yemen seek to oppose this reality then we shall set them right by force if necessary."
EGY_Arab6:0 "Demand the Suez"
EGY_Arab6_desc:0 "For too long has our territory been lorded over by foreign powers. We shall demand the Suez Canal be returned to our direct control. If they refuse, the sons of Cairo shall march forth and conquer!"
EGY_Arab7:0 "Revive the Cretan Claim"
EGY_Arab7_desc:0 "Crete was once entrusted to us and our links to the island stretch back millenia. If we were to regain it we would gain complete supremacy over the Eastern Mediterranean. We must revive this claim and demand that it be returned to the Egyptian bosom."
EGY_Internal1:0 "The Coptic Issue"
EGY_Internal1_desc:0 "The Coptic Church has been a delicate subject within the kingdom for fourteen centuries. While the Christian minority do us no real harm the populace is primarily (and fiercely) Muslim. We should consider whether to safeguard Coptic rights against those who would do them harm or shatter them to prevent any potenial political interference."
EGY_Internal2:0 "Safeguard the Copts"
EGY_Internal2_desc:0 "We have a long and proud tradition of sheltering those in need and to turn against the Copts would put our reputation at risk. We shall place the Coptic Pope under our protection from any who would harm him or his church"
EGY_Internal3:0 "Shatter the Coptic Church"
EGY_Internal3_desc:0 "For too long have our foolish ancestors tolerated this foreign actor preaching on our sovereign soil. We shall shatter this Pope#s church and send his followers scurrying into the sands."

EGY_Africa4:0 "Military Mission to Zanzibar"

### Events ###

egy.1.t:0 "The Sultanate of Egypt"
egy.1.d:0 "The History of modern Egypt conventionally begins from 1882 when Egypt became part of the British sphere of influence in the region, a situation that conflicted with Egypt's de jure position as part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1914 the Protectorate was made official and the title of the head of state, which had changed from pasha to khedive in 1867, was changed to Sultan. This formally repudiated the vestigial suzerainty of the Ottoman Sultan in Constantinople, who was backing the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg. Abbas II was deposed by the British and replaced as Sultan by his uncle, Husayn Kamil. Upon his death in 1917, his only son, Prince Kamal al-Din Husayn, declined the succession, and Husayn Kamil's brother Ahmed Fuad ascended the throne as Fuad I. With the signing of the Peace of Honour Egypt continued as part of a weakened British sphere. Despite this, Arab nationalism led to violent riots which convinced the British to unilaterally declare Egyptian independence in 1922, abolishing the protectorate and establishing a proper Kingdom of Egypt. Britain retained control of the Canal Zone, Sudan and Egypt's external protection. When the 1925 British Revolution broke out, Egypt occupied the Sudan, but was forced to give control over the Suez Canal to an ascendant Germany. Fuad I, who was seen as a British puppet, was forced into exile and replaced by his nephew and former monarch Abbas II, viewed as more friendly to German interests. With the decline of the Ottoman Empire in recent years, Arabs nationalism is on the rise and Egypt has decided to organise the first Congress of Arab Nations, set to be held in 1936. Together with Hejaz, they might try to free the Arabs still living under Ottoman rule."
egy.1.a:0 "We shall be the masters of our own destiny!"

egy.2.t:0 "Congress of the Arab World"
egy.2.d:0 "Originally an idea of Arab nationalists in Egypt, the planned Congress of Arab Nations will be a huge cultural event of great geopolitical and strategic importance. Professors, clerics, historians, novelists, diplomats and even cooks from all corners of the Arab world have been invited to join this tribute to Arab culture, situated in Cairo. This Congress could help improve the economic situation in the country and boost our relations with the Arab world, though foreign occupiers might view this as threatening Pan-Arabist and anti-imperialist propaganda."
egy.2.a:0 "Continue preparations for the Congress as planned."
egy.2.b:0 "These plans are too modest, this must be the event of the century!"
egy.2.c:0 "Abort the plans, this Congress is a waste of resources!"

egy.3.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.3.d:0 "After many months of planning, the Arab Congress begins. As guests come flocking in from all Arab lands, it has become clear that the Arab identity is not forgotten, but on the contrary is cherished by many. The streets, marketplaces, and mosques of Cairo are teeming with Arabs from many lands. In the coming days, they will take the stage and deliver addresses and lectures about a variety of subjects ranging from history to religion."
egy.3.a:0 "Truly a great day for all Arabs!"

egy.4.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.4.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. Should we too send a delegation?"
egy.4.a:0 "To Cairo!"
egy.4.b:0 "Pfff... Arabs Shmarabs, we're fine on our own!"

egy.5.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.5.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. We too were invited to send a delegation, this is the perfect opportunity to see if Egypt would be willing to join us in a collaborative effort to free the Arabs of the Ottoman Empire from Turkish occupation."
egy.5.a:0 "Send a cultural delegation only, we aren't warmongers"
egy.5.b:0 "Alongside Egypt we might just bring the Ottomans to their knees!"
egy.5.c:0 "I'm all the Arab this nation needs, nobody is going to Cairo!"

egy.6.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.6.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. Should we too send a delegation?"
egy.6.a:0 "Woman, pack your bags! We're going to Cairo! ...Cairo ...it's in Egypt baby..."
egy.6.b:0 "A cultural event...? BORING!"

egy.7.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.7.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government, the Arab Congress is a grand event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to pay homage to our illustrious Arab heritage. Should we too send a delegation?"
egy.7.a:0 "Let's see what the Arabs outside of Yemen are like..."
egy.7.b:0 "Maybe the good people in Cairo can help us get Aden back from the Germans!"
egy.7.c:0 "I can't go to Cairo, I'm busy... There's a rat in my kitchen, what am I gonna do?"

egy.8.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.8.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic-speaking provinces. Already symbols of solidarity have been seen publicly displayed in Damascus, Gaza and Basrah."
egy.8.a:0 "Can't we all just get along...?"

egy.9.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.9.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic-speaking provinces. Already symbols of solidarity have been seen publicly displayed in Tunis, Algiers and Constantine."
egy.9.a:0 "Our colonial empire will remain intact!"

egy.10.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.10.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic-speaking provinces. Already symbols of solidarity have been publicly displayed in the Canal Zone, Mukalla and Rabat."
egy.10.a:0 "We should keep an eye on this issue."

egy.11.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
egy.11.d:0 "Planned by Arab Nationalists in Egypt, the Arab Congress is an event in Cairo where delegates from all Arab nations convene to discuss the situation and preservation of the Arab culture and identity. Unfortunately, this awakened unwanted nationalism in our Arabic-speaking provinces. Already symbols of solidarity have been publicly displayed in Tangier, Melilla and Ceuta."
egy.11.a:0 "Morocco is Spanish and it will stay that way!"

egy.12.t:0 "The Result of the Arab Congress"
egy.12.d:0 "As the cultural events of the Arab Congress winded down, the chamber of delegates began to grow heated with irredentist shouts from the various members of the congress. The Hashemite state in the Hejaz had been the nucleus of pan-Arabism during the Weltkrieg and it was to Mecca that a huge amount of Arab nationalists from Syria and Mesopotamia emigrated once German reinforcements brought the hitherto victorious Entente to heel. It is widely believed that the dynasty of the Sharif is determined to once again spearhead the cause of Arab unification and put the rule of the hated Turk into the dustbin of history. But what of our Egyptian friends?"
egy.12.a:0 "We should ask for support in uniting all Arab lands under Ottoman rule!"
egy.12.b:0 "We must consolidate the Shariffian state."

egy.13.t:0 "The Sharif of Mecca Announces His Ambitions"
egy.13.d:0 "The Arab national government in Mecca has proposed that the Hashemite dynasty be the leading vanguard of pan-Arabism, thus laying claim to all of Ottoman Arabia. How should we respond?"
egy.13.a:0 "God wills it! Lend our support!"
egy.13.b:0 "Propose a partition of the Arab vilayets instead."
egy.13.c:0 "Suggest that OUR dynasty take on the role of Arabian unifier!"
egy.13.e:0 "We have absolutely no interest in this. Zilch. None. Zero."

egy.14.t:0 "Egypt Accepts"
egy.14.d:0 "The Egyptian government has announced its complete support for the ambitions of the Prophet's family! Soon the Turks shall fall before the might of Faisal!"
egy.14.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

egy.15.t:0 "Egypt Proposes a Partition of the Ottoman Vilayets"
egy.15.d:0 "The Egyptian government has proposed that we partition the Arab provinces already under Ottoman rule. Under this agreement, Greater Syria would go to Egypt, whilst we receive the fertile Mesopotamian provinces."
egy.15.a:0 "Accept this proposal!"
egy.15.b:0 "No. Reinforce our claims!"

egy.16.t:0 "Egypt Demands to Lead the Pan-Arab Movement!"
egy.16.d:0 "The Egyptian government has made clear that they aren't willing to allow the Hashemite dynasty to lead the cause of Arab unification. Instead they proposed the House of Muhammad Ali as the true liberator. What shall we respond?"
egy.16.a:0 "A small sacrifice for the freedom of all Arabs."
egy.16.b:0 "No. We are the True Arabs!"

egy.17.t:0 "Cairo-Mecca Axis?"
egy.17.d:0 "In order to liberate the Arabian peninsula and its inhabitants from the Ottoman Empire we need to form an alliance with other friendly Arabian countries such as Hashemite Arabia, which wants to see the Ottoman Empire crumble and disintegrate just as much as we do."
egy.17.a:0 "Send the proposition"
egy.17.b:0 "There is no need for an alliance"

egy.18.t:0 "Cairo-Mecca Axis?"
egy.18.d:0 "Egypt is seeking allies in order to achieve the main goal of its foreign policy, to see the Ottoman Empire crumble and disintegrate. Do we want to sign an alliance with Egypt knowing that they can involve us in new local wars?"
egy.18.a:0 "Yes, Arabian countries should stand together"
egy.18.b:0 "Isolationism will protect us!"

egy.19.t:0 "Cairo-Mecca Axis is formed"
egy.19.d:0 "Hashemite Arabia expressed its intention to join our alliance aimed at liberating Arabian nations from Ottoman dominance."
egy.19.a:0 "Welcome!"

egy.20.t:0 "Persian ambitions"
egy.20.d:0 "Egypt and Hashemite Arabia recently formed a new alliance aimed at the liberation of all Arabian lands from Ottoman dominance. Their goal is partially consistent with our desire to seize control over Mosul and Baghdad Vilayets. Shall we try to join their alliance or shall we wage war against the Ottomans on our own?"
egy.20.a:0 "Try to join the Arabian bloc."
egy.20.b:0 "We do not need Arabs to crush the Ottomans!"
egy.20.c:0 "Turn to isolationism!"

egy.21.t:0 "Persia wants to join our alliance"
egy.21.d:0 "Persia is seeking allies in order to achieve the main goal of its foreign policy, to seize Mosul and Baghdad Vilayets. Do we want to admit Persia as a new member of our alliance?"
egy.21.a:0 "Yes, we shall destroy Ottomans together."
egy.21.b:0 "Refuse them. They are not Arabs!"

egy.22.t:0 "Cairo-Mecca-Tehran Axis is formed"
egy.22.d:0 "Egypt accepted our request and admitted us to their alliance. Together we will crush the Ottoman Empire once and for all!"
egy.22.a:0 "Excellent!"

egy.23.t:0 "Report from the Middle East"
egy.23.d:0 "Our secret service reported that Egypt, together with other states in the Middle East, is planning to dismantle the Ottoman Empire in the future.
