cog.1.d:0 "Portugal, our old colonial overlord which dethroned us and kicked us out of our ancestral home of Mbanza Kongo, now demands us to bend the knee. In return, we will be granted our capital back, in addition to the region of Cabinda. If we refuse, its almost certain they will declare war"
cog.1.a:0 "Our survival in these trying times is more important than our pride"
cog.1.b:0 "We will meet them in battle!"

cog.2.t:0 "Kongo accepts"
cog.2.d:0 "The Manikong has accepted to submit to us and bring peace to his lands. In return, we will allow him to keep german equipment and personnel, and a large degree of autonomy. Portugal at least controls the Congo truly."
cog.2.a:0 "Welcome back to the fold!"

por.4.t:0 "The Kingdom of Portugal"
por.4.d:0 "After the disaster in the Weltkrieg, and the collapse of our forces in Mozambique and France, Portugal's usurper republic simply lacked the face and the military support to resist the Glorious Restoration, which brought Manuel II back to the throne, and his once rival claimant Duarte Nuno as his heir. After the restoration shortly after the war's end, the economy started to recover, but reliance on British imports and exports was too great for Portugal to properly weather the storm of 1925. Not even advantages could be take of the fall of the British Empire, for Germany, in an act of aggression, prevented the longtime ambition of uniting our main African provinces together. In facing such a political crisis, then Prime Ministers Paiva Couçeiro called for elections; and the victorious integralists have an extensive reform agenda, and viciously anti republican policies that polarised opinions even among staunch monarchists. However, they defer to the King for now, and they claim that they will so indefinitely, and Spain's sickness seems to never end, as more chaos looms in the world and threatens Portugal. In Africa, Hermann von Göring and his Hunnic goons sabotage our endeavours, forcing our hand to return the favour, and tensions are fast escalating. But no matter what is to come, we trust that Portugal will stand tall"
por.4.a:0 "Avante!"

por.300.t:0 "The Colonial Exposition of 1936"
por.300.d:0 "Thousands have gathered for Portugal's first large scale Colonial Exposition. While the Kingdom's restoration and our trials and tribulations have been challenging, Portugal did not shy away from its civilising burden, and redoubled efforts to improve its Ultramarine Provinces, which are as an integral part of Portugal as Porto or Lisbon. Many wonders from all over the world have been brought to Lisbon for the occasion, including an entire Angolan village as an anthropological curiosity. While the endeavour was expensive, it reinforces our commitment to the Colonial Cause"
por.300.a:0 "Grand!"

por.301.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Portugal"
por.301.d:0 "While economic ties with Germany have never been as large as in other European countries, the cascade effect of the Black Monday crisis hits Portugal with great force. With an economy mostly based on farming exports, and most industries focused on the rearmament plan, our usual buys cannot afford our products, and thus Portugal is again in a dire economic situation. Let us hope the lessons of the 26 Crisis have been learned, and we can recover more quickly this time."
por.301.a:0 "This is trouble!"

por.302.t:0 "The Coronation of Maria Ana I "
por.302.d:0 "As the old monarch was deemed unfit to rule and Abdicated, Maria Anna of Braganza has been crowned as Maria Ana I, and was recognised as such by the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers. Hopefully, her ascension will bring lasting peace to Portugal"
por.302.a:0 "Long Live the Queen!"

por.303.t:0 "The Coronation of Maria Adelaide as Maria III"
por.303.d:0 "With the deeply saddening passing of Duarte II, childless, the question of succession could have been rather contentious. However, his youngest sister, Maria Adelaide, was almost unanimously agreed as the best fit to be our next Queen by both upper and lower houses, for despite it's young age, she always was the Princess closer to the people. Long may Maria III reign, with hopefully more peace and calm"
por.303.a:0 "Long Live the Queen!" 

por.304.t:0 "Regicide!"
por.304.d:0 "As Duarte II was returning from a routine trip to the Chamber of Most Worthy Peers, his convoy was assailed by half four men, clad in black and well armed. The machinegun fire did not gravely wound the Queen, Maria Francisca of Orléans-Braganza, luckily enough, but innocent subjects of the Crown were. The wounds of the 1908 terrorist attack were re opened, and many in the Realm demand justice. While two of the 'soldiers' of the Legião Vermelha were shot down on the ensuing firefight, two terrorists spotted on camera, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, well known Anarchist brigands, have fled , presumably to seek refuge at the CNT-FAI regime in Spain. Given the gravity of the crime committed, all options are on the table, including an ultimatum towards them; careful analysis of diplomatic consequences would be advisable, but these two murderers will be brought to justice!"
por.304.a:0 "The CNT-FAI must surrender those responsible!"
por.304.b:0 "We must be cautious in this situation..."

por.305.t:0 "Portugal demands the return of the Regicide"
por.305.d:0 "While our struggle has been long, our problems do not end. Portugal's King, Duarte II, has been assassinated on the way back to his Palace after addressing the Upper House of that nation. Two men, Mário Castelhano and Emídio Santana, have crossed into our borders, while on the run from Portuguese authorities. Despite the success on the attempt at the King's life, public reception has not been unanimous; many bystanders were wounded in the operation. However, the men were armed here, by all accounts, and even without the approval of the FAI, accepting the Portuguese demand of deporation could be seen by the world as an admission of guilt; not to mention the men are likely dead if we hand them over. Also to ponder on the matter is the weight of this decision on a Global Scale; stating a war against Portugal and their reactionary allies while we are in a weakened state so recently after the Civil War may prove unwise, even with allies behind us. A choice must be made, regardless; Will we hand over the duo as demanded, or prepare for the Reactonary Retaliation?"

por.308.t:0 "Occupy Galicia?"
por.308.d:0 "The region of Galicia, Portuguese speaking all but in name, and long under Spain's yoke, is under the very real threat of falling under Syndicalist Tyranny. While some Intgralists argue for intervention to protect our brothers, many politicians expressed their concern at allowing Santiago de Compostela and the relics there to be looted by Anarchist bandits. Doing that could potentially weaken the Carlists even more, however, and will burn bridges with them if they ever manage to turn this conflict around"
por.308.a:0 "We must secure Galicia from the failing Carlists!"
por.308.b:0 "By doing this, we would be helping the Sydnicalist Hydra"

por.309.t:0 "Portugal Seizes Galicia!" 
por.309.d:0 "The slithering snakes in Portugal have occupied Galicia while our forces struggle against the godless forces of the CNT-FAI. While they claim it's to ensure their Galician 'brothers' from Syndicalism, its abundantly clear that this landgrab is little more than opportunism"
por.309.a:0 "We will correct this later..."

por.310.t:0 "Seize Olivença?"
por.310.d:0 "Olivença has been illegally under Spanish control since a mishap in the 1801 Treaty of Badajoz. With Spain in civil war, they are not in a position to contest our reclaiming, for while the border dispute has great potential propaganda value for us, the town is virtually worthless strategically"

por.310.b:0 "If it's so worthless, why betray a fellow Monarch while he struggles against atheists and traitors?"

por.311.t:0 "Portugal Seizes Olivença!"
por.311.d:0 "Portugal has occupied the small town of Olivenza, claiming it is long lost Portuguese land, and we are not in a position to react as of now. If we wish to recover it, it will have to happen at some later point!"

We will shape the Monarchy into something truly grand!"

por.314.t:0 "The Burden We Bear"
por.314.d:0 "We must rise over our petty differences, and unite under our Faith and our Country and our People. And most importantly, we must bring the light of civilisation to the poor unfortunate souls who need Christ in their lives. It's not an expensive or glorious endeavour to build outposts in the dark of the Jungle and spread civilisation, but it's nontheless our goal. And of course, defending our faith against those who seek to destroy it!"

por.315.d:0 "After the end of the Weltkrieg in the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in 25, Britain and Portugal have drifted apart even if they are formally allied. But now, storm clouds gather, should we turn to our oldest friend for aid?"
por.315.a:0 "We will renew the old's oldest and greatest alliance, and beat back the Syndicalist Hydra"
por.315.b:0 "We'll refrain for now."

por.316.t:0 "Portugal Asks Us To Rejoin the Entente Formally"
por.316.d:0 "After the end of the Weltkrieg in the Peace with Honour, and even more so after the Revolution in 25, Britain and Portugal have drifted apart even if they are formally allied. However, now that storm clouds gather over Europe, and the time to reclaim the birthright approaches, they ask to support us, and for us to support them, in the Great War to come"
