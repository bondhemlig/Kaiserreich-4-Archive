 sprd.1.t: "The Kingdom of Spain"
 sprd.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Spain: Once the greatest of the Colonial Empires, she saw all of her remaining overseas colonies lost after a swift war against the USA in 1898. After this, seperatist movements in both the Basque country and Catalonia arose, and both the Church and a radical worker's movement, the CNT, are interfering in her internal politics. Spain's populace has become deeply divided. \n\nAfter taking his place on the throne in 1902, King Alfonso XIII seemed keen on regaining Spain's former status as a colonial power by intervening in Morocco. The intervention lasted for a whole decade, and the outcome, while a victory, was not exactly in favour for Spain: Her Moroccan possessions remain a source of permanent unrest. Spain turned in on herself afterwards, remaining neutral during the Weltkrieg, all while the populace's faith in King Alfonso faded. \n\nAs a result of the General Elections of 1931, the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, and Alfonso, accepting the will of his people, went into exile. However, the Republic lasted only a short while. The Kingdom was restored by a coup d'état lead by General Sanjurjo just a year later. Still, the memories of the short-lived failure that was the Spanish Republic fuel the regime's opponents left and right. \n\nTo date, there remain deep divisions within Spanish society. On the one hand, the resurgent Carlist Movement, headed by Alfonso Carlos, aims to re-establish the 'True Dynasty' and recreate an integralist Christian monarchy, and on the other, the anarcho-syndicalist CNT-FAI seeks the abolition of the Spanish state altogether, and to replace it with a voluntarist federation of communes and economic collectives. If the political split is not mended, Spain might even see a Civil War."
 sprd.1.a: "Let us prevail."
 
 
 sprd.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Spain"
 sprd.2.d:0 "The Spanish economy has been tied to Germany since the end of the Weltkrieg. Since France and England's defeat, a good portion of our economy has been centred around exporting materials and goods to the German markets. As such, we can expect a flood of layoffs and closings. Our political foes will undoubtedly use this to their advantage."
 sprd.2.a:0 "We did not need this!"
 
 
 sprd.3.t:0 "Breakdown of our Society"
 sprd.3.d:0 "The bickering of both leftist and traditionalist fanatics have been driving the Spanish people into a frenzy, and the sustained economic crisis following Black Monday has poured gasoline onto the embers. Several political groups have called for open protest against our reign."
 sprd.3.a:0 "This is not going to end well."

 sprd.4.d:0 "Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, and the Carlist claimant to the throne of Spain, died today in Vienna at the age of 86. He died a natural death, so his passing should have put an end to the problem of Carlist succession, as the current King, Alfonso XIII, is now the head of the Capetian dynasty. Alas, the head of the Carlist community in Spain, Duke Javier de Borbón-Parma, was designated instead by the Duke as his rightful heir."
