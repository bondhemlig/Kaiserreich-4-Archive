 ### Events ###
 
lithuania.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Lithuania in 1936"
lithuania.1.d:0 "O Lithuania, land of the brave, where oaks grow strong and the people are hardy. What an ironic twist of fate it is that you were saved and 'freed' by the progeny of the same Teutons that pillaged and ravaged your land. You are once more a Kingdom, 700 years after the death of King Mindaugas I, and yet you are a mere puppet state in the middle of Mitteleuropa. While you are not as German-dominated as the United Baltic Duchy in the North, your position is still unbearable."
lithuania.1.a:0 "Interesting, tell me more!"
lithuania.1.b:0 "Yada, yada, just let me play!"

lithuania.2.t:0 "The Kingdom's State of Politics"
lithuania.2.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of the Kingdom in 1918, and especially after Syndicalist revolutions in the West, Lithuania has been dominated strictly by conservative politics. The clerical, pro-German and anti-Syndicalist Lithuanian Christian Democrats have worked hard to modernize your economy, but their reign might just come to an end, challenged by the nationalist and anti-German 'Party of Lithuanian Interests' led by Augustinas Voldemaras, as well as the resurgent Social Democrats under Vladas Pozela."
lithuania.2.a:0 "Really?"

lithuania.3.t:0 "The Kingdom's Overall Situation"
lithuania.3.d:0 "Lithuania is arguably the weakest member of Mitteleuropa, but it is critical to the effort of the Germans. It holds a strategic position between East Prussia and Germany's East Slavic puppets and it's the Kaiserreich's only meaningful way of access to the United Baltic Duchy. As such, the Kaiser will be more than willing to reign Lithuania in if it tries to rebel. Russia has a lot of interest in Lithuania, too, and the Belarusian minorities in the Vilnius region have led to friction between the Kingdom and the White Ruthenians. And what of the incoming clash with the International?.."
lithuania.3.a:0 "I'd rather play as Poland."

lithuania.4.t:0 "Adolfas Šapoka writes 'Lietuvos Istorija'"
lithuania.4.d:0 "A young Lithuanian historian, Adolfas Šapoka, has written and published a 600 page tome on the history of Lithuania from it's creation to present day. Seen as highly patriotic and pro-Lithuanian, it is definitely aligned with the views of the Lithuanian nationalists, and yet has been critically acclaimed and distributed across the country, with over 100 000 copies released by the end of the year."
lithuania.4.a:0 "A fine read. But also quite troubling."

lithuania.5.t:0 "Black Monday hits Lithuania!"
lithuania.5.d:0 "The rampaging economic downturn that started with the Berlin Stock Exchange has not left us out of the chaos. Now that hundreds of industries in Germany are closing and others kicking out unneeded workers, the demand for Lithuanian agricultural and industrial produces dropped like a rock. Fields are left deserted, unemployed workers line up for soup kitchens by the hundreds and the gross domestic product has plummeted. \n What can the poor Lithuanians do against this travesty?"
lithuania.5.a:0 "Who's going to buy our butter and geese now?"

lithuania.6.t:0 "Response to Black Monday"
lithuania.6.d:0 "An emergency session of the Seimas has gathered today to discuss the matters of the Lithuanian economy, which are getting worse by the minute. More and more factories are closing. Farmers, unable to sell their produces, sell their cows and spill their milk on the sidewalks. The unemployed gather in soup kitchens to survive. The Seimas is split between two major factions, both of which have their own ideas on how to solve the situation and get out of the Depression that has been caused by the Black Monday."
lithuania.6.a:0 "V.V. Carneckis - the state should build up profitable industries and industrialize"
lithuania.6.b:0 "J. Pleckaitis - the system must be reorganized to help the common man"

lithuania.7.t:0 "The economy has recovered"
lithuania.7.d:0 "After a long time of recovery and fighting the plague that was the economic crash of the Black Monday, the economy of Lithuania has seemingly started to recover. Unemployment is dropping and the value of the Lithuanian mark is finally coming back to pre-1936 levels. In slightly more morbid news, the suicide rate, previously leading in the entirety of Europe, is finally lower..." 
lithuania.7.a:0 "Good. I'll go loosen the noose, then."

lithuania.8.t:0 "The Third Front"
lithuania.8.d:0 "While syndicalist wretches are thriving in the French commune and the rest of the Internationale, Lithuania used to be solidly defended by these ideas. That has been proven false by the discovery of an underground newspaper called 'The Third Front' (Trecias frontas). While it presents itself as a collection of modernist avant-garde litreature that can't be published in traditional media, it is also heavily far-left and agitates for ushering in a new and better Syndicalist government in the nation. How should we respond?"
lithuania.8.a:0 "They are no threat, syndicalism cannot thrive here"
lithuania.8.b:0 "Disperse their circles!"

lithuania.9.t:0 "Nationalist Rally"
lithuania.9.d:0 "The streets are filled with patriotic members of the Speak Lithuanian movement today, with over a few thousand activists marching across the city and demanding to rid the country of German influence. \n After visiting the local cenetery to pay respects to the heroes that fought in the Weltkrieg to create the nation as we know it, then returned to the cities, where minor violence began. A few civilians, most of German origin, were injured, a few store windows were left broken and shattered, but eventually the crowds dispersed. \n A few of the most radical participants were arrested, but they are small fries compared to the men organizing this mess..."
lithuania.9.a:0 "Horrible!"

lithuania.10.t:0 "Blue Cockades Organize Rally"
lithuania.10.d:0 "The streets are filled with left-leaning students, workers and sympathizers today, as the Lithuanian syndicalist movement, the Blue Cockades - taking the symbolish from the cockades Lithuanian revolutionaries used to wear during the Kosciuzko Uprising in 1794. They acll for the evictment of German and capitalist influence in the country and the creation of a Lithuanian syndicalist state. \n\nPolice reports prequent clashes between the blue-clad dissenters and the numerous Lithuanian nationalist gangs, the Iron Wolves. Nobody was killed, but many were sent to hospitals or arrested. However, none of the leaders were found, despite known ties to the Lithuanian Work Federation and the underground Democratic Syndicate of Lithuania."
lithuania.10.a:0 "Horrible!"

lithuania.11.t:0 "Election of 1938"
lithuania.11.d:0 "The early rays of the spring sun have begun to melt down the snow across the country, but the politics of the nation are as unstable as ever. Parades of Nationalist militias and dissenters flood the streets hoping for a victory at the election, and the voter turnout has been the highest since the nation's inception. The Christian-Democrats received blows to their popularity from the events of Black Monday, but nevertheless remain strong, while the Social-Democrats are attempting to rally the working class into voting for them. How will the people decide?"
lithuania.11.a:0 "The Christian Democrats remain in power"
lithuania.11.b:0 "Social-Democrats secure a majority"
lithuania.11.c:0 "A coalition of Nationalist parties led by Voldemaras obtain victory"

lithuania.12.t:0 "Change in Political Situation"
lithuania.12.d:0 "Now that the Constitution of 1920 has been revised and updated, making our country more democratic, the stances of the ruling party have changed, too. We can no longer call ourselves authoritarian, we are not a Prussian Constitutional monarchy anymore. We are a full democracy, just with a figurehead king."
lithuania.12.a:0 "Good"

lithuania.13.t:0 "The End of the Kingdom" 
lithuania.13.d:0 "As the declaration of the abolishment of the position of King of Lithuania and the arrest of Karl Gero von Urach, former Mindaugas III, finalized, the entirety of Lithuania was now transformed into a much different state. The last bits of democracy have been swept away, the Seimas has been dissolved, and the Party of Lithuanian National Interests now reigns supreme. Augustinas Voldemaras has declared himself to be the Leader - Vadas - and put his Iron Wolf brigades to work. \n\nThe creation of the Lithuanian National Republic can now only be stopped by Germany, whose interests in Lithuania have now been sorely broken..."
lithuania.13.a:0 "Lietuva lietuviams!"

lithuania.14.t:0 "Lithuania declares independence!"
lithuania.14.d:0 "The dastardly Lithuanians have betrayed us! After the election of 1938, which was won by the national populist Party of Lithuanian National Interests, more commonly known as 'Speak Lithuanian', the puppet Kingdom was rapidly transformed into a radical nationalist republic, with Augustinas Voldemaras as the Vadas - Leader. \n\nThe Lithuanians have already seized numerous Lithuanian companies and arrested important German representatives in their nation, even their former King Karl Gero von Urach, and declare that they will listen to no one. How should we respond?"
lithuania.14.a:0 "We will crush them in the blink of an eye!"
lithuania.14.b:0 "We have more important matters, leave them be. For now"

lithuania.15.t:0 "A second in command for the Vadas?"
lithuania.15.d:0 "Now that we are fully in control of the Lithuanian nation, we have to shape the government of the new National Republic into the most preferrable for our patriotic goals. The Vadas, Augustinas Voldemaras, already has a bunch of possible candidates from the party, and he needs a second in command, the person who will keep ties between him and the cabinet of ministers. Which option should we pick?"
lithuania.15.a:0 "Vladas Mironas, a Catholic priest, liked by the people."
lithuania.15.b:0 "Petras Kubiliūnas, the head of the Iron Guard paramilitaries."
lithuania.15.c:0 "Juozas Eretas, Voldemaras's most loyal follower."
lithuania.15.d:0 "Do all of them know better than the Vadas? Voldemaras will keep the position!"

lithuania.16.t:0 "Peace with Lithuania?"
lithuania.16.d:0 "It has become apparent that the Lithuanians will not be an easy nut to crack. Even though the countries of Mitteleuropa surround them from all sides, their forces have been able to push back our advances and even captured Konigsberg, the capital of East Prussia. Perhaps we should let the Lithuanians go and keep our focus on other fronts instead."
lithuania.16.a:0 "Offer them Memel in exchange for peace."
lithuania.16.b:0 "It's just a temporary setback!"

lithuania.17.t:0 "Germany offers peace"
lithuania.17.d:0 "Our armed forces are victorious! The Germans, seeing that they will not be able to defeat us that easily, now offer peace! They even give us the chance to keep Klaipėda, the heart of Lithuania Minor, in the National Republic. Should we accept this peace proposal or keep pushing forward?"
lithuania.17.a:0 "It's a deal."
lithuania.17.b:0 "No, let's press for more!"

lithuania.18.t:0 "The Lithuanians have accepted"
lithuania.18.d:0 "The Lithuanians have agreed to our proposal. A peace treaty has been signed between the two nations in captured Memel, and Memelland has now been returned to the Lithuanian side. Mitteleuropa walks away in shame, and now Germany no longer has a land route to it's eastern puppets..."
lithuania.18.a:0 "As soon as the armistice ends, we'll take it back"

lithuania.19.t:0 "The Lithuanians have declined"
lithuania.19.d:0 "Peace negotiations have broken down! The Lithuanians perhaps got too confident, and now believe that they can push even beyond Konigsberg! While they are of course foolish to believe that they can take down the Kaiserreich itself, the fact that we now have one more long-term front to deal with is not good for our situation..."
lithuania.19.a:0 "Time for a third Tanenberg, then."

lithuania.20.t:0 "Peace with Lithuania?"
lithuania.20.d:0 "It has become apparent that the Lithuanians will not be an easy nut to crack. Even though the countries of Mitteleuropa surround them from all sides, their forces have been able to push back our advances and even captured a large portion of our territory. Perhaps we should swallow the defeat and concede the lands they have taken."
lithuania.20.a:0 "Offer Novogrudok in exchange for peace."
lithuania.20.b:0 "It's just a temporary setback!"

lithuania.21.t:0 "White Ruthenia offers peace"
lithuania.21.d:0 "Our armed forces are victorious! The White Russians, seeing that they are losing against our might, now offer peace! They even give us the chance to keep Naugardukas, one of Lithuania's core territories hundreds of years ago. Should we accept this peace proposal or keep pushing forward?"
lithuania.21.a:0 "It's a deal."
lithuania.21.b:0 "We'll reunite the Grand Duchy! All of it!"

lithuania.22.t:0 "The Lithuanians have accepted"
lithuania.22.d:0 "Peace negotiations have been finalized in Minsk, and our diplomats walk away in shame. White Ruthenia has been defeated, and Lithuania has annexed the territory of Novogrudok. The lands of the White Rus' shrink even more, and the strength of our nation is being sapped away, bit by bit. But at least peace has returned to our lands."
lithuania.22.a:0 "At least we still have Minsk..."

lithuania.23.t:0 "The Lithuanians have declined!"
lithuania.23.d:0 "The Lithuanians have got confident and believe that Novogrudok is not enough! In their point of view, the armies of their National Republic can conquer the entire White Ruthenia, despite their small size!"
lithuania.23.a:0 "We will never surrender!"
