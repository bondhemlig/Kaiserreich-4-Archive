### Events ###

socitaly.1.t:0 "The Socialist Republic of Italy"
socitaly.1.d:0 "At the end of the Weltkrieg, Italy was in disarray. It collapsed into chaos, with the victorious Central Powers divying up the once proud nation. While the northern half of Italy would become occupied by the Austrian Empire, the southern half would become the reformed Kingdom of Two Sicilies, with an Austrian puppet upon the throne. This decision wsas vastly unpopular amongst the south Italian peasantry, leading to a series of peasant revolts and uprisings. Soon, Anarcho-Syndicalist thinkers fleeing from the Austrian occupation in the north arrived in Naples and began to build support for a revolution. In February 1921, Palmiro Togiallti and Amadeo Bordiga led a revolution. The Austrians were unable to halt the Syndicalist tide, and after two months of civil war the Syndicalists triumphed and the Socialist Republic of Italy was declared. \n\n Unfortunately, the Republic's troubles had merely just begun. Power struggles and purges ensued, and southern Italy was still in shambles from both the civil war and the Weltkrieg. Now, 15 years since the Republic's founding, the nation is only just barely starting to rebuild and industrialise. Hampered by the Italian Federation to the North and the insidious criminal Sicilian Mafia that has grown over the past few years within their own borders, the nation is beset by challenges and dangers on all sides."
socitaly.1.a:0 "Forward!"


socitaly.2.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union"
socitaly.2.d:0 "Today, the Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union begins. The various factions of the Congress will debate economic, internal, and military policies. The Anarcho-Syndicalists seek to push Orthodox Syndicalism, advancing the current policies of the congress, while the Social-Reformists desire a government that helps the people, with an expansion of social programs. Meanwhile, Benito Mussolini's new faction, the National-Syndicalists, advances the new ideology of Totalism, advocating for absolute state power and aggressive military expansion. The very future of the Republic hangs in the balance."
socitaly.2.a:0 "Let's get to work!"

socitaly.3.t:0 "Day 1: Economic Policy"
socitaly.3.d:0 "The first order of business is the economic policy of the Republic. The Social-Reformists advocate for moderate industrialisation, whilst also expanding Italy's agriculture. The Anarcho-Syndicalists argue for industrialisation, and Mussolini's National-Syndicalists demand nothing short of total and immediate industrialisation."
socitaly.3.a:0 "Social-Reformists: We must expand both our industry and our agriculture."
socitaly.3.b:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalists: We should focus on industrialisation."
socitaly.3.c:0 "National-Syndicalists: Nothing short of total industrialisation will suffice!"

socitaly.4.t:0 "Day 2: Internal Policy"
socitaly.4.d:0 "While discussing internal security. the Mafia problem emerged as the dominant topic of debate. The factions of the party are staunchly divided on how to approach the issue. The Social-Reformists wish to increase social spending to help the population in areas affected by the Mafia in hopes of reducing Mafia authority, whilst the Anarcho-Syndicalists wish to empower the Republican Guard to fight off the criminals. The National-Syndicalists take things a step further, arguing for expansive secret police services and surveillance in order to bring this threat -- and any other -- to a swift end."
socitaly.4.a:0 "Social-Reformists: Focus on social spending and helping the people!"
socitaly.4.b:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalists: Increase funding and empower the Republican Guard!"
socitaly.4.c:0 "National-Syndicalists: Utilise every tool available to smash the Mafia threat, no matter what."

socitaly.5.t:0 "Day 3: Military Policy"
socitaly.5.d:0 "The final order of business is the matter of the Republic's military. The Social-Reformists propose a small, professional army for self-defence purposes, while the Anarcho-Syndicalists push for a large people's army in preparation for the war with North Italy. Mussolini's National-Syndicalists' proposal is the most radical yet: extreme demographic controls in an effort to increase the population for future manpower."
socitaly.5.a:0 "Social-Reformists: A small, professional army for self defence!"
socitaly.5.b:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalist: A large, people's army!"
socitaly.5.c:0 "National-Syndicalist: Demographic controls to ensure a strong military in the future!"

socitaly.6.t:0 "Fourth Congress of the Greater Italian Union - Social Reformist Majority!"

socitaly.10.t:0 "Compromise between the Anarcho-Syndicalists and Social-Reformists!"
socitaly.10.d:0 "In an effort to box out the dangerous National-Syndicalists, the Anarcho-Syndicalists and Social-Reformists have agreed to form a coalition government. Palmiro Togliatti maintains his role as president, while Giacomo Matteotti becomes the new Chairman of the House of Commons."
socitaly.10.a:0 "Better than nothing."

socitaly.11.t:0 "The Italians Cannot Decide"
socitaly.11.d:0 "During the Congress of the Greater Italian Union, none of the three factions achieved a clear majority. Maybe we can help them choose their new government?"
socitaly.11.a:0 "Support the Social-Reformists!"
socitaly.11.b:0 "Support the Anarcho-Syndicalists!"
socitaly.11.c:0 "Support the National-Syndicalists!"
