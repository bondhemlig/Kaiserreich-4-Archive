amcivwar.24.d.ceasefire:0 "What could have been the greatest capitalist oppressor of the 20th Century is now firmly under the control of the working class. Throughout the country, the working class celebrates its liberation from the depredations of their bourgeois masters. While there is still much to do, and the so-called Pacific States of America still lie in wait across the ceasefire line, today we can celebrate this victory and savour the air of an America where, for the first time, each man is truly equal."
amcivwar.24.a:0 "Solidarity Forever!"

amcivwar.25.t:0 "The End of the Second American Civil War"

amcivwar.25.d.ceasefire:0 "Huey Long and his allies have triumphed over almost all their enemies - all save the so-called Pacific States of America, lying across the ceasefire line until a future final reckoning. For now, we can celebrate a new era of peace. Though there is much rebuilding to do we shall take this time to celebrate our victory."
amcivwar.25.a:0 "The Real America Still Stands!"

amcivwar.26.t:0 "The End of the Second American Civil War"
amcivwar.26.d.noceasefire:0 "The enemies of America have been destroyed. Once again, the South has been pacified, and the syndicalist menace has been suppressed. The threats to the American way of life have been destroyed, and the great system designed so wisely by the Founding Fathers has survived another threat. Now across the country, the people can rejoice and celebrate a new era of peace."
amcivwar.26.d.ceasefire:0 "The South has been pacified and the syndicalist menace has been suppressed. These threats to the American way of life have been destroyed, although with the so-called Pacific States of America lying across the ceasefire line, the United States is not yet whole. Even so, the great system designed so wisely by the Founding Fathers has survived another threat and the people can, for the moment, rejoice and celebrate a new era of peace."
amcivwar.26.a:0 "Down with the traitors, up with the stars!"

amcivwar.27.t:0 "The End of the Second American Civil War"
amcivwar.27.d.noceasefire:0 "The enemies of America have been destroyed.

amcivwar.27.d.ceasefire:0 "Though [ACW_survivor.GetNameDef] yet exists across the ceasefire line, the other factions in the civil war have fallen and the battles are done... at least for now.

amcivwar.28.a:0 "It's finally over..."

### CSA Flavor Events ###
amcivwar.29.t:0 "Building a Red Navy"
amcivwar.29.d:0 "The Admirals of the United States have prevented any of their ships from being liberated by the workers and thus we are deprived of a navy. To solve that, those admirals that joined the revolution and the countless dock workers are planning on building up a new navy. We do have quite a number of ships in New York that we can convert to warships. We can either go with destroyers or cruisers. What shall we go for?"
amcivwar.29.a:0 "Destroyers"
amcivwar.29.b:0 "Cruisers"

amcivwar.30.t:0 "Central Committee Directive #10: Regulation Governing the Redistribution of Material Assets"
amcivwar.30.d:0 "Now that the revolution has begun, we must decide what should be done to the bourgeoisie. The IWW proclaim we confiscate all their wealth and redistribute it to the people immediately. The up-and-coming Vanguard has called for their immediate arrest and execution as well, citing the fate of Vladimir Lenin as an example of a revolution defeated by leniency. SPA members belonging to the depreciated AFL, along with several loyal Progressives have sought life over death. Asking the Central Committee to only expropriate what is necessary for war, and keep their materialist constituents happy. "
amcivwar.30.a:0 "Their wealth and their lives are ours!"
amcivwar.30.b:0 "We may need these moderates in the future."

amcivwar.31.t:0 "Bourgeoise Flee to Canada"
amcivwar.31.d:0 "The bourgeoise have decided that they will flee the CSA. Thousands have sought refuge within enemy territory, Especially within the illegitmate Canadian government. The thieving scum have taken whatever of their stolen wealth they could carry with them as they have escaped the revolution."
amcivwar.31.a:0 "The revolution will come for them, in time."

amcivwar.32.t:0 "Life in the midst of war"
amcivwar.32.d:0 "The revolution has brought a number of changes throughout the land that we control. In the various towns and cities, bourgeoise culture seems to have vanished for the most part. Women and foreigners are now applying for union membership in droves. This being necessary, as all factories are now effectively closed shops.The words 'comrade', 'brother', and 'citizen' have replaced Boss and Sir in public literature. Most people, at least in public, now shun the gaudy fashion that had been so typical of the past decade's America in favour of functional jumpsuits, or some variation on military uniforms."
amcivwar.32.a:0 "The thinking revolution is underway."

amcivwar.33.t:0 "Central Committee Directive #213: War Syndicalism"
amcivwar.33.d:0 "As the war stalemates and perhaps may even turn against us, the Central Committee is debating a comprehensive economic reform proposal known as 'War Syndicalism.' Some of its proposals, such as state control of all foreign trade, nationalization of all factories, strict labour discipline are not especially controversial. It also includes potentially problematic measures such as the outlawing of  wildcat strikes, obligatory labour-duty for those not working or in the military, strict food rationing, and military control over railroads. This is seen as tyrannical within the SPA with a number saying that some of the latter measures, especially the outlawing of wildcat strikes would betray the values of the revolution, and make the current government no better than its Capitalist enemies. Those supporting the proposal in the IWW and Vanguard counter that it is necessary in order to achieve victory in the revolution, and that the first laws passed after the end of the war will revert War Syndicalism."
amcivwar.33.a:0 "Enact War Syndicalism"
amcivwar.33.b:0 "We will live and die free men!"

amcivwar.34.t:0 "The Red Witches"
amcivwar.34.d:0 "Gender equality has long been a major ideological component of socialist thought, and we have yet more evidence that it works! A squadron of female pilots has earned renown throughout the CSA for their daring raids on enemy territory, their coordinated and synchronized attack formations allowing them to take down larger enemy air forces with ease. Derisively named the 'Red Witches' by the reactionary forces under Huey Long, the squadron, led by Florence 'Pancho' Barnes, has taken their new nickname up with a great deal of pride."
amcivwar.34.a:0 "Death is in the air"

amcivwar.35.t:0 "Female Soldiers"
amcivwar.35.d:0 "As the Revolutionary struggle continues a number of women have joined the armed struggle in accordance with the socialist ideals of gender equality. While not all are accepted by their male comrades, it has not deterred many from fighting and dying for the revolution. Manuals have been distributed to recruiters on how to effectively organize Women Detachments, of which the militas can teach the military a thing or two."
amcivwar.35.a:0 "Rebel Girl, you are the queen of my world!"

amcivwar.36.t:0 "Internal Conflicts"
amcivwar.36.d:0 "At the offset of the revolution, John Reed placed the IWW as the model and future successor to Congress. The AFL, which has seen a decline in membership before 1935, was revitalized by Reed's endorsement. Now the AFL, as a part of the coalition fighting the socialist revolution, has begun to exercise their ideological autonomy. They have choosen to occupy the entire left side of the IWW, and begun to pull in allies. Their debates with the IWW can sometimes leak out into street brawls, and, in two cases, friendly fire. The Vanguards, owing only their alligence to the revolution, have tried to foster cooperation. Now Reed must decide whether it is more danger to continue his support for the IWEW, when compromise is in sight. "
amcivwar.36.a:0 "Side with the IWW"
amcivwar.36.b:0 "Force a compromise"
amcivwar.36.c:0 "Side with the AFL"

amcivwar.37.t:0 "Central Committee Directive #656: Winter Resource Allocation Program([GetYear])"
amcivwar.37.d:0 "The revolution must succeed, but the revolution is also for the people. When supporting the revolution and supporting the people are the same, the choice is trivial, but when one must be prioritized over the other, hard choices must be made. The Central Committee has been made aware that the supply situation is critical, and either the people or the army must be undersupplied through the winter."
amcivwar.37.a:0 "Prioritize the People"
amcivwar.37.b:0 "Prioritize the Army"

amcivwar.38.t:0 "Central Committee Directive #764: Revolutionary Education Act"
amcivwar.38.d:0 "To those who are well educated, either formally or through bitter experience, revolutionary thought comes as easily as breathing. However, many of our comrades, whether in the Steel Belt or elsewhere in America, have been lied to their entire lives by the capitalists, and do not understand how the revolution frees them. Many do not give their heart and soul to the revolution, and some even attempt to sabotage our efforts, unaware that we are the only force that truly cares for them. This must be remedied, and our comrades must be deprogrammed. Should we focus on reaching those in our territory, keeping our own morale up, or should we spread our message throughout enemy territory, and sap their will to fight their liberators?"
amcivwar.38.a:0 "Focus on the Home Front"
amcivwar.38.b:0 "Focus on the Enemy"

amcivwar.39.t:0 "Central Committee Directive #984: Sentencing of Pre-War Capitalist Politicians"
amcivwar.39.d:0 "As the revolution nears success, the people demand that we deal with the corrupt, capitalist politicians in office before the revolution who now rot in our cells. Some believe that by having these politicians work hard labour for a few years, they will empathize with the worker, and be converted to our cause. Others believe that no amount of education can reform them, and they must remain behind bars for the rest of their lives. A small, but vocal minority insists that they must be executed for their crimes, like the Romanovs or the Bourbon dynasties of old."
amcivwar.39.a:0 "They shall be redeemed by the sweat on their brows and the ache of their backs"
amcivwar.39.b:0 "They shall watch as the world leaves them behind and makes them irrelevant"
amcivwar.39.c:0 "They must be put to death for their crimes. It is now our turn, and we shall not make excuses for the terror!"

amcivwar.40.t:0 "Central Committee Directive #1231: Establishment of the Committee for Intelligence Activities"
amcivwar.40.d:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that there are spies and saboteurs within our territory working to prevent our glorious liberation of the proletarian masses. Of the many proposals submitted to the Central Committee, one stands out. Earl Browder's proposal is to create a committee to enforce revolutionary order and stop counter-revolutionary sabotage. However, others within the Central Committee, including Chairman Reed, wonder if this is a necessary step and if we would be betraying our ideals. Regardless, a vote was taken. What was decided?"
amcivwar.40.a:0 "The Committee for Intelligence Activities will be created!"
amcivwar.40.b:0 "It is not necessary for now."

amcivwar.41.t:0 "Red Terror"
amcivwar.41.d:0 "War is hell. Civil war, even more so. The psychological strain caused by having to repeatedly kill, even if the enemy are capitalists, has caused some of our soldiers and commanders to become sadistic beyond what some consider to be acceptable. Although not commonplace, reports of systematic mass executions and torture are being reported from both the front lines and core territories to suppress populations suspected of aiding the capitalist factions. Reed has made an executive decision to supress these reports from the free media. 'If the revolution were to fail because a few bad apples', says Reed 'then humanity would collectively suffer for centuries longer'."
amcivwar.41.a:0 "This is the final conflict, after all"

amcivwar.42.t:0 "Central Committee Directive #1398: Amendment to CCD 64, Governing Minimum Conscription Age"
amcivwar.42.d:0 "The war is not going our way. The detestable capitalists have pushed back our forces on all fronts, and we are in danger of running out of troops to man the guns we have. Desperate times require desperate measures, and one proposal, by William Z. Foster that has caused controversy is the proposal to lower the conscription age to 11. While this would provide us with the manpower needed to fight the revolution, quite a number of members of the Central Committee have expressed horror at this drastic measure."

### AUS Flavor Events ###

amcivwar.46.t:0 "Appeal to Reason"
amcivwar.46.d:0 "Charles Lindbergh has arranged a meeting between Huey Long and a number of leading industrialists including Henry Ford, Fred Koch, and H.L. Hunt. These men are inclined to close their factories and refineries within the South to comply with orders from the Federal Government. However, they are instead persuaded by Lindbergh to stick up for Huey Long and move their business empires into the American Union State on a few conditions. They ask that Huey Long guarantee some sort of political exception to them in these dire economic times as well as a promise of political office once the war is won. If Long agrees to their demand, it will give them greater influence and many of his supporters will wonder if he plans on betraying his ideals. However, refusing in such a time may prove costly."
amcivwar.46.a:0 "Agree to their reasoning"
amcivwar.46.b:0 "Refuse their reasoning"

amcivwar.47.t:0 "War Industries Committee"
amcivwar.47.d:0 "Business leaders within our territory have formed a committee ostensibly in support of Huey Long in order to coordinate the war effort on his behalf called the War Industries Committee. Just as Huey Long himself had created offices to handle the monumental task of fighting for America, so did the industrialists take it upon themselves to create an industrial institution. Though they do not have all the power that they were promised, they have declared themselves to be the arsenal of the Republic, and are led by controversially antisemitic but respected General George Van Horn Moseley."
amcivwar.47.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them"

amcivwar.48.t:0 "Pledge of Allegiance"
amcivwar.48.d:0 "One of the more unusual well-wishers to visit Huey Long is an eccentric but passionate man named William Dudley Pelley. Pelley is the leader of an all-white Legionarist political and religious social club called the Silver Legion. His membership size is moderate but his enthusiasm for Huey Long's ideals is unsettlingly enthusiastic. Pelley has come with a request for money to take on an evangelistic and patriotic tour of America to gather supporters for the American Union State. This proposal would imply to Huey's followers that he supports the fledgling Christian Identity movement, which clashes with his personal distaste for the political ideology of Klansmen and Prohibitionists. How shall we respond?"
amcivwar.48.a:0 "We agree to this deal"
amcivwar.48.b:0 "We refuse this deal"

amcivwar.49.t:0 "The Silver Legion"
amcivwar.49.d:0 "Along the way during the national tour, William Pelley came into contact with radio preacher Herbert W. Armstrong. In order to raise an army for the American Union State in favour of what they see as a moral war, they have officially combined their beliefs to form the Pelley-Armstrong line. This has swelled the Silver Legion into the tens of thousands of members from all across the country, and reports of their speeches have come in. In inclusion to the strongly anti-Catholic and pro-segregationist rhetoric at these speeches are promises that are said to come from Huey Long in favour of almost extraordinary wages for whites and benefits for veterans after the civil war. As these have entered the rumour mill there is nothing we can do to stop these promises from spreading."
amcivwar.49.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them"

amcivwar.50.t:0 "Chief of Staff"
amcivwar.50.d:0 "With the civil war raging all around us and the fact that we do not have a chief of staff has prompted concern among various political and military leaders. Thus they met with Huey Long to appoint a Chief of Staff to win this war."

amcivwar.54.d:0 "The admirals of the United States have prevented any of their ships from being liberated by the true patriots of America and thus we are deprived of a navy. However, we do have a number of admirals and sailors that are planning on building up a new navy. We do have quite a number of ships in Houston that we can convert to warships. We can either go with destroyers or cruisers. What shall we go for?"
amcivwar.54.a:0 "Destroyers"

### USA events ###

amcivwar.61.t:0 "Conscription"
amcivwar.61.d:0 "With the war going on the question, is should we implement conscription or not. Doing so would provide us with the men we need to restore order to the country. However, it is not a popular move. Some suggest focusing on Propaganda instead."
amcivwar.61.a:0 "Implement conscription"
amcivwar.61.b:0 "Focus on Propaganda instead"

amcivwar.62.t:0 "Marines return from China"
amcivwar.62.d:0 "With the outbreak of the civil war, our garrison in the legation cities has been recalled back to the US to fight. This has left our diplomats in China in a bit of a bind, however, with the civil war raging we need all the men that we can get."
amcivwar.62.a:0 "Welcome the Boys home"

amcivwar.63.t:0 "Panama Garrison"
amcivwar.63.d:0 "With the outbreak of the civil war, the garrison in Panama has decided to return to America to fight for the government. This has left the canal defenceless but on the other hand, we need everybody that we can to fight."
amcivwar.63.a:0 "Welcome the Boys home"

amcivwar.64.t:0 "Hardship of the civil war"
amcivwar.64.d:0 "The civil war is bringing the hardship home. People within a number of loyal cities are starving. We could focus on relieving their suffering,  but this will mean diverting supplies that are needed for the front to fight the civil war. Congress and the Military are at odds in this regard. What should we do?"
amcivwar.64.a:0 "Relieve Civilian Suffering"
amcivwar.64.b:0 "Support our Troops"

amcivwar.65.t:0 "Martial Law?"
amcivwar.65.d:0 "With the civil war raging a question has come about suspending habeas corpus and enforcing martial law in occupied territories. Those within our General Staff are even divided, as it could create more rebels than it defeats pre-emptivly. It might allow us to keep things under control during the civil war but such a move is naturally controversial. What shall be done?"
amcivwar.65.a:0 "Enforce Martial Law"
amcivwar.65.b:0 "We shall not take this action"

amcivwar.66.t:0 "Loyalist Terror"
amcivwar.66.d:0 "During the ongoing civil war, some of our commanders started to use rather doubtful methods to permanently suppress civilian populations suspected of helping our mortal enemies. When pressed, the President has defended their actions, stating 'Only discretionary violence was used, any commander capable of true brutality has already become a rebel'. "
amcivwar.66.a:0 "We can only hope"

amcivwar.67.t:0 "Native American Codetalkers"
amcivwar.67.d:0 "A number of native American tribes have decided to support us and offer their services. Notably, this should help with hiding our communications since there are few people who speak the various languages of the native Americans."
amcivwar.67.a:0 "This should help"

amcivwar.68.t:0 "Conscientious Objectors"
amcivwar.68.d:0 "A number of men and women, particularly among religious like the Jehovah's Witnesses and the Mormons, do not wish to engage in war, have objected to fighting in the conflict. We can try to silence them or we can offer them to work in non-military jobs to help the war effort. Public opinion seems to be divided, as super-patriots have begun to assault objectors during their demonstrations."
amcivwar.68.a:0 "The public will handle them"
amcivwar.68.b:0 "Make them work"

amcivwar.69.t:0 "Double V Campaign"
amcivwar.69.d:0 "As we are fighting the various traitors, leaders of the NAACP have begun to push for what is being called the Double V Campaign, Victory for America and Victory against Racism. Not all African-Americans wish to fight for the Socialists of the Combined Syndicates of America and few are welcome within in the American Union State and thus a campaign has begun to fight for America and to help win the civil war as well as to help fight against racism within America."
amcivwar.69.a:0 "Victory for America and Victory against Racism!"

amcivwar.70.t:0 "Militarize the WASPs?"
amcivwar.70.d:0 "Congress is debating a bill to militarize the Women Airforce Service Pilots(WASPs) in a similar fashion to the WACs and WAVES. This would require the government to provide the expenses for the WASPs similar to the other two organizations instead of having the female pilots themselves pay the expenses. It would not have them fly in combat situations, since that is still the job for the Male pilots. Despite this it is facing quite the pushback from Congress as many regard the WASPs as not as experienced as male pilots and not suited for the job. The question then is what shall congress vote to do?"
amcivwar.70.a:0 "Congress votes to Militarize the WASPs"
amcivwar.70.b:0 "Congress votes to not Militarize the WASPs"

### Foreign Interventions

amcivwar.150.t:0 "America in Chaos"
amcivwar.150.d:0 "The United States of America has descended into a civil war, with syndicalists right on our doorstep and Huey Long rallying forces to oppose both. Chaos has overtaken our neighbours to the south. We are thus presented with two choices: one is to stay out of the conflict and consider supporting one of the non-syndicalist factions, with the hope of eventually having a new ally once the dust is settled. The other is to activate Defence Plan Two and occupy strategic locations while preparing for a worst case scenario where the syndicalists win, even though no American faction would be pleased with us. In neither case do officials support going to war and wasting British and Canadian lives on a fight that isn't even for the Home Isles."

amcivwar.199.d:0 "It is beginning to dawn upon our citizens that the American civil war is actually over. The scars from the fighting will last for a long time, but it seems as if the feeling has already started to sink in that any chance to change America's destiny further has passed.

amcivwar.199.a:0 "God bless America!"


### Rocky Mountain Ceasefire ###

amcivwar.200.t:0 "A Possible Ceasefire"
amcivwar.200.d:0 "The civil war has ravaged America, and there is a growing discussion within the government regarding approaching [CAL.GetNameDef] for a possible ceasefire. Whether the Pacific rebels would even consider such a thing is unknown, but if it occurred it would give us time to consolidate our hold over the east and for our men to recover. Eventually a reckoning would be necessary, of course, but if we don't attempt this now the war may drag on even longer as a result."
amcivwar.200.a:0 "Let's meet them in Denver"
amcivwar.200.b:0 "No, there's no point in this"

amcivwar.201.t:0 "Ceasefire Talks in Denver"
amcivwar.201.d:0 "With the war between [survivor.GetNameDef] and [CAL.GetNameDef] dragging on, talks have been held between highly-placed officials on both sides regarding a possible ceasefire. This comes at the urging of the [survivor.GetAdjective] government, though it's unknown just how much traction there currently is. We shall see within a couple of days whether anything comes of it."
amcivwar.201.a:0 "An interesting idea?"

amcivwar.202.t:0 "The Proposal"
amcivwar.202.d:0 "After two days of talks, army officials have put together a proposal: any states west of the Mississippi River which are currently occupied by [CAL.GetAdjective] forces would be ceded to [CAL.GetNameDef], with some gaps filled in on the map - though nothing they can't properly supply. The rest would be ceded to [survivor.GetNameDef]. Outside of that, there are no guarantees and no talk of actual peace... eventually there will be a reckoning. Both sides simply call for hostilities to stop for now, for damage to be assessed, and for the living to take a much-needed breath."
amcivwar.202.a:0 "This will do"
amcivwar.202.b:0 "They're asking for too much!"
ACW_agree_proposal:0 "Agree to the proposal as it stands"
ACW_we_will_try_again:0 "We will go back to the table and try again..."

amcivwar.203.t:0 "There Will be no Ceasefire"
amcivwar.203.d:0 "Perhaps it was too much to hope for. Talks between both sides in Denver fell apart without any real agreement, and any hopes for a ceasefire have vanished. The war resumes."
amcivwar.203.a:0 "So much for that"

amcivwar.204.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.204.d:0 "Talks with [CAL.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the eastern side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."
amcivwar.204.a:0 "It's peace for now"

amcivwar.205.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.205.d:0 "Talks with [From.GetNameDef] have concluded, and the ceasefire is going ahead. Already our troops are pulling back to the western side of the new border. How long this will last remains to be seen."
amcivwar.205.a:0 "It's peace for now"

amcivwar.206.t:0 "The [ACW_ceasefire_name]"
amcivwar.206.d:0 "Civil war has ravaged America for many months, but today a ceasefire was called in the conflict after a meeting in Denver between officials of [CAL.GetNameDef] and [survivor.GetNameDef] worked out terms. Pacific forces would withdraw to new boundaries west of the agreed-upon border, while [survivor.GetAdjective] forces would withdraw eastward. This is not an official peace, however, and many feel that a future reckoning between the two countries - a final showdown, as it were, for the future destiny of America - is all but inevitable. Even so, this is a moment of respite for each side to gather their strength and count their dead, and Americans on both sides are celebrating a bit of peace snatched from the jaws of chaos."
amcivwar.206.a:0 "We'll see how long it lasts"

### Liberia and Philippines in Chaos ###

amcivwar.212.t:0 "America in Chaos"
amcivwar.212.d:0 "Liberia has been under the economic and effective political dominance of the USA since its foundation as a colony for freed slaves in 1822. This dominance has also helped to protect her from European colonial powers. However, now the USA is in chaos, as rival political factions make a bid for the Presidency. The conflict has now deepened to the point of war. No longer can they be relied upon for protection. Now we must decide how we are to survive."
amcivwar.212.a:0 "We will seek protection from National France"
amcivwar.212.b:0 "Germany is the only one strong enough to protect us now."
amcivwar.212.c:0 "Lap Dogs no longer - We can protect ourselves!"
amcivwar.212.e:0 "We aren't traitors - Stay loyal to the Americans"

amcivwar.213.t:0 "Liberia asks for protection"
amcivwar.213.d:0 "With the American Civil War in full swing, their former protectorate of the tiny Republic of Liberia has approached us with a request for diplomatic and military protection, as they feel the US is no longer able to grant them this. How shall we answer?"
amcivwar.213.a:0 "Yes, the Liberians will be useful allies"
amcivwar.213.b:0 "They are unprotected - seize their lands!"
amcivwar.213.c:0 "We do not want them"

amcivwar.214.t:0 "The French agree to protect us"
amcivwar.214.d:0 "The French nationalists have agreed to protect us, in return for certain diplomatic and economic concessions. Once again, we are secure!"
amcivwar.214.a:0 "Hurrah!"

amcivwar.215.t:0 "Liberia under attack"
amcivwar.215.d:0 "The foreigners now they seek to seize our lands for themselves. We have no choice but to fight for our survival!"
amcivwar.215.a:0 "Mobilise as many men as possible."

amcivwar.216.t:0 "The French refuse our request"
amcivwar.216.d:0 "Unfortunately the French have declined to protect us..."
amcivwar.216.a:0 "We must move to independence"

amcivwar.217.d:0 "With the American Civil War in full swing, their former protectorate of the tiny Republic of Liberia has approached us with a request for diplomatic and military protection, as they feel the US is no longer able to grant them this. How shall we answer?"
amcivwar.217.a:0 "Yes, they will be useful allies"
amcivwar.217.b:0 "Yes, but grant administration to Mittelafrika"
amcivwar.217.c:0 "We do not need them"
amcivwar.217.e:0 "They are unprotected - seize their lands!"

amcivwar.218.t:0 "The Germans agree to protect us"
amcivwar.218.d:0 "The Germans have agreed to protect us, in return for certain diplomatic and economic concessions. Once again we are secure."
amcivwar.218.a:0 "Hurrah!"

amcivwar.219.t:0 "We are granted Liberia as a puppet."
amcivwar.219.d:0 "The Kaiser has proposed making the nation of Liberia a satellite state of ours. This news is good as we control yet more of Africa."
amcivwar.219.a:0 "Our Power Grows"

amcivwar.220.t:0 "Germans turn us over to Mittelafrika"
amcivwar.220.d:0 "The Germans have proposed putting us under the protection of Mittelafrika, their African colonial administration. At least we have a protector, now."
amcivwar.220.a:0 "Hurrah!"

amcivwar.221.t:0 "The Germans refuse our request"
amcivwar.221.d:0 "Unfortunately the Germans have declined to protect us. We stand alone in the world."
amcivwar.221.a:0 "We will have to be independent."
amcivwar.221.b:0 "Turn to National France instead"

amcivwar.222.t:0 "Liberia stands alone"
amcivwar.222.d:0 "The tiny nation of Liberia has broken away from US protection and is now alone. We could try to seize the lands for ourselves, although this would not be a popular move among both allies and enemies."
amcivwar.222.a:0 "We have no ambitions on Liberia"
amcivwar.222.b:0 "They are unprotected - seize their lands!"

amcivwar.223.t:0 "Liberia stands alone"

amcivwar.223.a:0 "We have no ambitions on Liberia"
amcivwar.223.b:0 "They are unprotected - seize their lands!"

amcivwar.224.t:0 "The French attack"
amcivwar.224.d:0 "The greedy, imperialist French have decided to attack us as we have no protector. We have no choice but to fight for our survival."
amcivwar.224.a:0 "Mobilise as many men as possible."

amcivwar.225.t:0 "The German-Afrikaans attack"
amcivwar.225.d:0 "Taking advantage of our diplomatic isolation, the German administration in Mittelafrika has decided to attack us. We have no choice but to fight for our survival."
amcivwar.225.a:0 "Mobilise as many men as possible."

amcivwar.226.t:0 "Independence in the Philippines"
amcivwar.226.d:0 "The civil war in America has left the American hold over the Philippines weakened. The people of the Philippines are demanding full independence but some in the government are worried that an independent Philippines will be absorbed by the greater powers in the area."
amcivwar.226.a:0 "Freedom. Horrible, horrible freedom."

amcivwar.227.t:0 "Seizing American Equipment"
amcivwar.227.d:0 "With the Americans heading off the island, they have left large amounts of equipment in the Philippines. The Filipino army is advocating seizing the resources while they are unguarded but the government is afraid of what this might do to the relations between the two countries."
amcivwar.227.a:0 "Seize the equipment"
amcivwar.227.b:0 "We should stay friendly"

amcivwar.228.t:0 "The American Mission in the Philippines"
amcivwar.228.d:0 "The war has forced the US government to recall all available units. The American forces in the Philippines are still loyal to the US government and Douglas MacArthur. Some are concerned that abandoning the Philippines will be costly but the forces are needed in America."
amcivwar.228.a:0 "Recall the units"
amcivwar.228.b:0 "We must hold our position"

amcivwar.229.t:0 "The Philippine Commonwealth"
amcivwar.229.d:0 "The Americans had never promised the Filipino people independence and forces inside the country wanted to use the American Civil War as an opportunity to declare independence and form a legitimate government. The Commonwealth of the Philippines was created to administer the nation and transition into a full state of independence."
amcivwar.229.a:0 "Our glorious new commonwealth"

amcivwar.230.t:0 "United States in disarray"
amcivwar.230.d_1:0 "The civil war has erupted in the United States, tearing apart the last shreds of unity in the Union. American influence on our government has in a matter of days all but collapsed and this development also presents us with the chance to fully remove the American presence from Cuba by occupying Guantanamo Bay naval base. There is very little that the US government can do to stop us at this point."
amcivwar.230.d_2:0 "Having broken free from the United States and the civil war raging still, the status of the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay has arisen. Should we seize this last piece of occupied Cuban soil?"
amcivwar.230.a:0 "Seize the naval base!"
amcivwar.230.b:0 "Rather not"

amcivwar.231.t:0 "Cuba Seizes Guantanamo naval base"
amcivwar.231.d:0 "With America in turmoil, Cuba has moved its troops onto the USA-leased Guantanamo Bay naval base. There is very little that the US government can do to stop Cuba at this point."
amcivwar.231.a:0 "Too bad"

amcivwar.232.t:0 "United States in Disarray"
amcivwar.232.d:0 "Turmoil has broken the union and the United States had erupted into civil war. With the federal government unable to exert a modicum of the influence it once had, our status as all but a puppet of the United States has become increasingly flimsy. Should we expel the Americans from our government or remain loyal?"
amcivwar.232.a:0 "Break Free"
amcivwar.232.b:0 "Stay Loyal"

amcivwar.233.t:0 "Cuba Defies Us"
amcivwar.233.d:0 "Cuba has broken its obligations to us and treaties concerning our relationship and arrest several American citizens influential in Cuba. With the civil war raging, we have lost much of our influence in the country."
amcivwar.233.a:0 "Horrible"

amcivwar.234.t:0 "Our Friends in Havana"
amcivwar.234.d:0 "In spite of the civil war and subsequent collapse of our influence in their nation, Cuba has promised to remain by our side and not only support our war against the traitors, but offer to provide us with materiel where possible as well. As their loyalty seems assured and we can no longer effectively administer our naval base at Guantanamo Bay, it may be wise to transfer control of the bay over to the Cubans. Whether this will be a temporary or permanent solution, only time will tell."
amcivwar.234.a:0 "Give it to them"
amcivwar.234.b:0 "Keep it"

amcivwar.235.t:0 "The United States Returns Guantanamo Bay"
amcivwar.235.d:0 "In gratitude for our loyalty and recognizing their inability to administer the area, the United States has returned their concession at Guantanamo Bay to us."
amcivwar.235.a:0 "Great!"

amcivwar.236.t:0 "The United States Defeated"
amcivwar.236.d:0 "The United States of America has been defeated. While this will of course also destroy their influence over our government and many loyalist politicians will be granted asylum, without our friend in Washington, our regime faces a great deal of uncertainty."
amcivwar.236.a:0 "On Our Own Then"
