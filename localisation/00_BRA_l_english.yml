 bra.1.t:0 "The Political Situation"
 bra.1.d:0 "Brazil's fragile First Republic has been on the brink of its end since her humiliating defeat by Argentina on last year's war. The apparent stability represented by the 'Café com Leite' doctrine - the dominance of Brazilian politics by the landed oligarchies of São Paulo and Minas Gerais - is revealing itself a farse, as general dissent against the federal government becomes more and more apparent. Old rivalries between different sectors of society are awaken. Unsatisfaction by the local elites of the South and Northeast against the government in Rio, and also by the industrialists in São Paulo, is growing. The 'cangaço' bandits, led by figures like Lampião and Corisco, are running rampant and harassing farmers in Ceará, Bahia and Pernambuco. The Brazilian Workers Confederation, an umbrella organization for the syndicalist movement, is sponsoring heavy labor strikes in the South-Southeast. Meanwhile, populist and nationalist thoughts are growing amongst the army and the middle class. Not even the armed forces can be trusted anymore: the 'Tenentes', the nonpartisan junior officers who organized the mutinies amongst the Army during the final stages of the war, can - and will - be mobilized by any side of the political spectrum. Emergency elections have been called for August, and some say that only a miracle can save democracy in Brazil."
 bra.1.a:0 "Let us wait until August, then."
 bra.2.t:0 "Padre Cícero passes away."
 bra.2.d:0 "This morning, father Cícero Romão Batista, died peacefully during his sleep at the old age of 92. The local leader, revered as a saint by the peasantry of the northeastern states, was seen as an éminence grise by the political class in Ceará, acting as a neutral mediating party on disputes between the Coronéis, the landed oligarchs of the northeast."
 bra.2.a:0 "His charisma will be missed."
 bra.3.t:0 "The Brazilian Communist Party dissolves itself"
 bra.3.d:0 "This morning, the small city of Cruzeiro, São Paulo, was visited by the remaining leaders of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB, Partido Comunista Brasileiro) as they organized their clandestine IV Party Congress. Founded in 1922 and much present on the very early days of the labour movement, the PCB is now a shadow of its former self, as a great part of its leaders and members have moved to other movements and parties, such as the Workers and Peasants Bloc (BOC, Bloco Operário e Camponês), the Brazilian Workers' Confederation (CBT, Confederação Brasileira dos Trabalhadores) and the Socialist Revolutionary Party (PSR, Partido Socialista Revolucionário). The strict adherence to the old Soviet Bolshevist doctrine by the party inner circle is seen by most as the main reason for its failure. With this in mind, the rump party voted by a great majority to dissolve itself and be absorved by the CBT. A small part of the old guard, however, led by Octávio Brandão, is keeping an eye on the developments of the Totalist ideas in Britain, and have already announced that the Party may be refounded on the near future."
 bra.3.a:0 "Ok."
 bra.4.t:0 "Major industrial strike in São Paulo"
 bra.4.d:0 "Today the Brazilian Workers Confederation, led by Astrogildo Pereira, announced a major strike in São Paulo. All the industry has stopped producing as most of the city's workers have joined the movement. The picketers are demanding a complete review of the labour laws, instituting a common minimal wage for all states and other workers rights. The organization is willing to negotiate starting now."
 bra.4.a:0 "Cave in to their demands."
 bra.4.b:0 "We will not negotiate with them unless they stop their strike."
 bra.4.c:0 "They are simply bandits, send in the police."
 bra.5.t:0 "CBT strike in São Paulo continues"
 bra.5.d:0 "The main industrial hub of the country is still on a complete halt as the Brazilian Workers Confederation mantains their picketing. The movement now is threathening to spread west to Rio de Janeiro, as the local CBT chapter led by Minervino de Oliveira has already announced their intent to join in. Some in the government say that we can't be held ransom by syndicalist scum and recommend a heavy police action."
 bra.5.a:0 "We can't risk an escalation, negotiate with the syndicates."
 bra.5.b:0 "Send in the police, the army and everything we have!"
 bra.elections.1.t:0 "Brazilian Presidential Election, 1936"
 bra.elections.1.desc:0 "Due to the unstable political situation in our country, specially after our defeat on the Platine War, emergency elections have been called for the 1st of August. Four main coalitions are disputing: first, we have the Aliança Nacional Libertadora (ANL, National Liberation Alliance), a broad front for the left-wing parties, composed of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the political sides of the BOC and CBT syndicates. Next, we have the Liberal-Democrats (Liberal-Democratas), an ad-hoc coalition of center-left and liberal forces under former president Júlio Prestes, politically-experienced and presenting themselves as a moderate alternative to the present situation. Further to the right we have the Republicans (Republicanos), an union of conservative parties, joining landowners and industrial capitalists with the right-wing forces of the military under the leadership of populist Getúlio Vargas. The fourth main coalition are the authoritarian Brazilian Integralist Action (AIB, Ação Integralista Brasileira), the nationalist and populist party under Plínio Salgado. After a very passionate campaign, the elections took place today. As the votes were counted, the next President of Brazil was announced..."
 bra.elections.1.a:0 "Aliança Nacional Libertadora - Edgard Leuenroth"
 bra.elections.1.b:0 "Liberal-Democratas - Júlio Prestes"
 bra.elections.1.c:0 "Republicanos - Getúlio Vargas"
 bra.elections.1.d:0 "Ação Integralista Brasileira - Plínio Salgado"
 bra.elections.2.t:0 "Edgard Leuenroth inaugurated as President"
 bra.elections.2.d:0 "Despite all of the setbacks we have suffered on the previous years, the Aliança Nacional Libertadora grand coalition has managed to elect Edgard Frederico Leuenroth, of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, as the next president of Brazil. The fifty-five year old journalist and long-time anarchist was one of the organizers of the general strikes in São Paulo in 1917-1919, helping establish the anarcho-syndicalist movement in the country. He was seen, thus, by the ANL leadership, as their obvious candidate for the presidency. And today is his inauguration day! Despite what some purists think, we may be forced to work on a coalition with some left-wing elements of Liberal-Democrats to appease some parts of the middle classes. A much more palatable solution for us would be asking the left-wing Tenentes into our coalition. Others, however, still think we can handle the whole government all by ourselves."
 bra.elections.2.a:0 "Ask for support from the Liberal-Democratas."
 bra.elections.2.b:0 "Invite the left-wing Tenentes into the ANL."
 bra.elections.2.c:0 "The syndicalist movement needs no alliances."
 bra.elections.3.t:0 "The new Chief Minister"
 bra.elections.3.d:0 "At least until we enact a new constitution, the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, although real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. All the three main parties of the ANL have put forward their own candidates for the post. Lívio Xavier of the BOC, Astrogildo Pereira of the CBT, and João da Costa Pimenta of the PSR. So, who shall we choose?"
 bra.elections.3.a:0 "Lívio Xavier"
 bra.elections.3.b:0 "Astrogildo Pereira"
 bra.elections.3.c:0 "João da Costa Pimenta"
 bra.elections.4.t:0 "Júlio Prestes returns to the presidency"
 bra.elections.4.d:0 "We were assured that the Brazilian people still believes on democracy. Júlio Prestes, president from 1930 to 1934, will return to office. Despite all the mess which has been brought to the country by the incompetence of the present government and by extremists from the right and left, the very institutions upon which the Federative Republic has been laid down were not shaken. And we know democracy is all about negotiating and laying alliances, right? Some parts of our bloc believe in asking the center-left elements of the military into our coalition, which will appease the armed forces. Others, however, think that inviting Getúlio Vargas and his Republicans would calm down the landowners and other conservative forces. So, what shall we choose?"
 bra.elections.4.a:0 "Form a coalition government with the center-left Tenentes."
 bra.elections.4.b:0 "Invite Getúlio!"
 bra.elections.4.c:0 "Our coalition needs no alliances."
 bra.elections.5.t:0 "The next Chief Minister"
 bra.elections.5.d:0 "Although the President of Brazil acts as Head of State, real power must be shared with his Chief Minister of the Presidency (Ministro-Chefe da Casa Civil). He is responsible for assisting the President, overseeing all cabinet requests and bureaucratic procedures involving the Presidency, and is also responsible for negotiations with the state governments, with both houses of the Congress and with the remaining Ministers. Our bloc has put forward three different candidates for the post. Washington Luís, president from 1926 to 1930, supported Júlio Prestes both on his 1930 campaign and on this year, so he would be a most likely choice. Two other candidates must also be considered, however: former Piauí governor Olímpio de Melo and Borges de Medeiros, the traditional gaúcho politician. Choosing a chief of staff from a smaller state, instead of the paulista Washington Luís, would grant us a greater support base among the traditionalist classes, altough we will miss the former president's political expertise."
 bra.elections.5.a:0 "Washington Luís"
 bra.elections.5.b:0 "Olímpio de Melo"
 bra.elections.5.c:0 "Borges de Medeiros"
 bra.elections.6.t:0 "Getúlio Vargas assumes the presidency"

Coming from a traditional rancher family of the southern Pampas, Vargas was seen by his coalition as a compromise candidate, appeasing the landowners from the South, Southeast and Northeast, the industrial bourgeoisie and, thanks to him states rights platform, the whole range of conservative forces. Plus, his populist speeches also seduced a portion of the proletariat, thanks to his promises of new labour laws and a more efficient social security system. Now, for a even more effective governing of Brazil, we must consider some political alliances with the other voting blocs. Should Vargas attempt a deal with the right-wing Tenentes led by Eurico Gaspar Dutra, his old friend from his time on the army? Some, however, are dreaming about a coalition with the nationalist Ação Integralista Brasileira. Despite the obvious differences between the pro-states rights Republicanos and the autoritharian AIB, some of their policies are perfectly compatible with ours.

A few experts say that these enterprises are a huge money drain to the state, diverting capital that would see better use in other areas, so we should privatize them. This, however, would increase costs for the final consumer, making life even harder for the people. Other economists, however, defend that we should keep these companies with us, since they were established with taxpayers money and thus belong to the people and the state of Brazil.

Some say we could fold in to their demands and distribute them those lands as a gesture of goodwill, although giving in to the demands of socialist bandits would certainly drive our supporters mad.

The Integralists attacked the syndicalist group with clubs, leaving two dead. Hours later, however, the group was met by syndicalist militiamen, and a major streetfight ensued.

 bra.53.d:0 "Time is coming to implement the first of the populist promises we made to the people. The Brazilian countryside is dominated by large farms, the latifúndios, owned by powerfull families and employing an enormous workforce. They are probably the most important element of our economy, harvesting the coffee and sugarcane so necessary for our exports. These latifúndios, however, also hold many unused plots, which could very well be occupied by landless farmers. One of our congressmen has put forward a proposal for a land reform programme which would distribute this empty land among poorer peasants. Not only this would increase our agricultural output, but since we would be adressing a key issue for the peasants, their support for the more radical syndicalist movements is likely to decrease. Some conservative forces, however, may see this as a sign of our weakness against these same radical ideologies."

Vargas himself has called the group to Rio de Janeiro to assure there's nothing to worry about. These measures will be useful to diminish the popularity of the extremist socialist movements amongst the peasants and even the urban proletariat - after all, why should they put their faith on a syndicate like the BOC if the federal government itself is fulfilling their needs? Even so, some of these more conservative landowners do not feel confortable about all this."

 bra.67.d:0 "After so many economical reforms, the industralists and landowners want to know something once and for all: what is their role on the Integralist state? Our doctrine stipulates that Capitalism is a doctrine as harmfull to society as Socialism, since free market allows for the accumulation of capital in the hands of just a few individuals. However, these capitalists are much necessary for our society and for the stability of our regime, so it could be wise to accomodate them in our structure. Some autoritharian groups from abroad, such as the American Union Party, have thought of setting up a lower chamber of the Senate for these people. That may be something to think for the future."

 bra.68.t:0 "Dealing with the trade unions"
 bra.68.d:0 "The trade unions of Brazil, specially those aligned with the two main syndicates of the country (the CBT and the BOC), have been a major issue for our Integralist regime. While the core leadership of these organizations is made of commited socialists and have been an active opposition towards our government, their power is being diluted as more and more as the workers are sympatizing with our cause. However, this support is tenuous at most, as the bulk of these proletarians can revert to socialism at any greater sign of crisis. With this in mind, our cabinet has proposed three different solutions to this issue. Filinto Müller of the Federal Police proposes a simple crackdown and dissolution of the trade unions! If we force these organizations underground, their political power will simply dissapear. Our Ministry of Industry proposes instead that we simply replace their leadership with more loyal workers. By putting Integralist proletarians in power, we will be sure of the continuous support of the unions to our doctrine. The core of our regime, however, made of Plínio Salgado and other theorists like Gustavo Barroso and Miguel Reale, defend the integration of the syndicates on our government structure. 'Only by granting the proletarians an active voice on our government', they say, 'we can be sure that the demands of even the most humble of Brazilians will be listened'"

This would effectively move all serious opposition to our government underground. However, some elements of our cabinet think we should be very cautious now. A persecution of our opposition would alienate the tenuous support we have from the workers and the middle classes."

The Patrianovistas are a traditionalist Catholic group, professing a anti-liberalist, anti-socialist doctrine, favouring the restoration of the House of Braganza and a complete reshuffling of Brazilian society along a doctrine much similar to the Action Française of Nationalist France or Spanish Carlism - in fact, a thought much similar to our own Integralism. Many members of the Patrianovistas are also sympatizers (when not full members) of the Brazilian Integralist Action. The opposite is also true, with a few commited Integralists being also high-ranking Patrianovistas. Veiga dos Santos, now, has proposed a full merging of both movements, with the Patrianovistas becoming full members of the AIB. No matter how tempting this proposal may seem, we must take a careful approach. Many Integralists are traditionalist catholics, but the militant monarchism of the Patrianovistas goes against some of our core principles."
