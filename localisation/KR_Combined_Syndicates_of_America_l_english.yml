  combinedsyndicates.19.d:0 "The physical health of the Head of the Central Committee, Jack Reed, has been deteriorating for a while now, to the point that a public announcement has had to be made concerning it, as it can no longer be concealed. The exact cause of his illness is currently unknown, but the wasting effects of it are shortening his life. Whilst his passion for the revolution remains untempered, his ability to lead it may not last much longer."

  combinedsyndicates.20.d:0 "At 23:14 the Head of the Central Committee, Jack Reed, after valiantly fighting for his life and his country, and having managed to live to see his dream of a Syndicalist America, has passed away.

  combinedsyndicates.26.d:0 "Despite their best efforts to work together, William Foster and his associate Max Shachtman have publically fallen out at a meeting of the Central Committee on the topic of economic policy. Foster accused Shachtman of not being willing to test the strength of the country in the name of progress. Shachtman countered that Foster's demands would have an unacceptable social cost. Ultimately a compromise was reached, but the public are aware there is discord at the highest echelon."

  combinedsyndicates.27.d:0 "Despite their best efforts to work together, Ben Gitlow and his associate Robert La Follette have publically fallen out at a meeting of the Central Committee. Gitlow accused La Follette of being a popinjay who doesn't know what he's talking about. La Follette responded that Gitlow was an old-stiffneck with no vision. The pair of them later apologised and both blamed it on the stress of their job. Regardless the public are aware there is discord at the highest echelon."

  combinedsyndicates.28.d:0 "With California finally under our control, we need to decide what to do with its film industry. Our leadership is divided between leaving the studios to their own devices (Barring our new film censorship and approval board) and purging the whole area and using the money to create something more useful to the state. While purging and industrializing the area would speed California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our citizens will be upset at the loss of entertainment."

  combinedsyndicates.43.d:0 "A level of stability had returned to the countryside in America. The CSA government had turned its attention to the small state of New England.

  combinedsyndicates.36.t:0 "The Pacific Question"
  combinedsyndicates.36.d:0 "The CSA had been victorious in the war and now was forced to deal with the PSA.
