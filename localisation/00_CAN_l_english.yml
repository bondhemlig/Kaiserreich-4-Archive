George V's health is steadily declining and, despite his sickness, continues to oppose the moderating influence of the Prime Minister on Canadian politics. Senile and obsessed with reclaiming the Empire George V lends influence to the British exiles who now sit in the Canadian House of Lords ( formerly the Senate).  Their presence in the upper house threatens to endanger the Prime Minister’s legislative program. While Canada has grown strong by an influx of expertise, capital and technology, it remains an uncertain player on the world stage. The next few years of Mackenzie King’s government will decisively shape the country’s future…"

This proposal is even more ambitious than the plans of Bishop and would call for great reform. The problem with the proposal is that it recommends that this be a Canada first endeavour and calls for the removal of older RAF advisors from the program to get a fresh perspective.

The vision to take back the home islands had been the predominant vision for the Canadian military but many see this as an unrealistic goal and are looking for a change to the current paradigm. Conservatives in the country still believe that retaking the isles is the best approach but the liberals are concerned that the effort to take the isles is leading Canada atray and believe that Canada comes first.

Collins was unable to subdue the loyalist elements fully and the reds will likely fare no better. By secretly supplying arms and equipment to loyal factions in Ulster we could count on them once war with the Syndicalist dogs comes to rise up for our cause. In doing so they might secure for us a foothold in Ireland putting us within reach our ultimate goal: the restoration of our United Kingdom! Intelligence has also contacted several groups opposed to the new Irish government in the south. While these are no allies of Collins and his IRA they are still Republicans.  They are composed of avowed anti-syndicalists and supporters of the National Centre Party and Fianna Fáil who have been forced underground. If we were to help arm and organise these disparate groups into an 'Irish National Army' it would greatly increase our chances of success but would upset members of the loyalist militias who wish for a return of the monarchy to Ireland as well as members of our armed forces for whom the memories of the Irish War are not easily forgotten."

 canada.200.t:0 "Implementing Social Credit"
 canada.200.d:0 "Social Credit is an economic philosophy that was developed by Clifford Hugh Douglas during the Weltkrieg.  He believes that the current economic system was designed to create a plutocracy through unnecessary scarcity and that the workers needed to be freed from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production. Douglas' reform program containted two main elements, a national dividend to distribute money equally to all citizens to bridge the gap between earning power and prices, and a price adjustment mechanism that would forestall the possibility of inflation. Now that we are in power we can work to implement these ideas throughout the nation. However critics have accused Social Credit of being 'syndicalistic' and as such it would perhaps be wise to moderate our plans lest they draw anger."
