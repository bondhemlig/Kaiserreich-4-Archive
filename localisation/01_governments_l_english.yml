 totalist_subtype_desc:0 "Totalism is both a specific ideology, and a category sometimes given to name various radical left wing ideologies with similar characteristics. As an ideolgy, Totalism promotes a new direction for socialism in the world, emphasizing the the role of the socialist state as the core ideal of the nation, while devaluing or abandoning the Marxist ideas of worker empowerment and a classless utopia. Totalists look to centralize and expand the governments' powers in socialist states, believing that the goal of the government is to build socialism in the state, and often use nationalist and militarist rethorics and policies. Due to their authoritarian nature, other authoritarian or totalitarian socialist ideologies have gained the name "Totalist" even if they are not affiliated with the totalist charter."
 syndicalist_subtype_desc:0 "Anarcho-Syndicalism is the leading marxist revolutionary ideology, which promotes democratic federations of collectivized trade unions as the basic political and economic units of the socialist state. Trade unions are equally owned by all the workers who are members in them, and have complete economic and political control over the workplaces they organize, and are given great amounts of autonomy from the central government. On a larger scale the various trade unions elect members to regional and national trade union congresses, which form the legislative and executive powers of the central government."

 paternal_autocratist_subtype_desc:0 "Paternal Autocracy is not a political ideology in the normal sense of the word, but rather a general term for the attitude that these governments hold towards their citizens: The people are all subjects of the leader, either a king or a dictator, and it is the leader's job and duty to lead the state and society towards the rightous and best path while uniting the people of under his benevolent protection. These countries usually have a very authoritarian government, conservative social views and a state controlled economy."
 national_populist_subtype_desc:0 "Encompassing a variety of ultra-nationalist and militaristic movements, National Populism typically venerates devotion to the state, uniting the people under a strong leader and a corporatist economy.
