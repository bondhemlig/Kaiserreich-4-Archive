### Event text ###
  combinedsyndicates.1.t:0 "The Second American Revolution"
  combinedsyndicates.1.d:0 "The Central Committee of the Combined Syndicates of America have issued a proclamation that all power in the former United States has now legitimately passed to the working classes, to be exercised through a Continental Chamber of Syndicates and defended from external enemies by the Revolutionary Syndicate Guards.  The Secretary of the new Chamber is..."
  combinedsyndicates.1.a:0 "Norman Thomas, to improve worker's rights"
  combinedsyndicates.1.b:0 "Max Schachtman, to nationalise the major industrial concerns"
  combinedsyndicates.1.c:0 "Paul Mattick, to sweep away all vestiges of the capitalist system"
  combinedsyndicates.1.e:0 "William Z. Foster, to create a disciplined army of labor"
  combinedsyndicates.2.t:0 "Where Will we govern from?"
  combinedsyndicates.2.d:0 "With the end of the civil war, we should decide where our capital will be.  Will it stay at Chicago or will it be moved back to Washington?"
  combinedsyndicates.2.a:0 "Capital remains in Chicago."
  combinedsyndicates.2.b:0 "Washington has been cleansed of capitalist influences."
  combinedsyndicates.3.t:0 "Rebuilding Revolutionary America"
  combinedsyndicates.3.d:0 "The civil war had caused great damage throughout the country and there was much that needed to be done to ensure that the US would be great again. Reed believed that a strong industrial base would not only help the country rebuild but also help with unemployment. The rebuilding of the country would not be easy and would require a great deal of planning."
  combinedsyndicates.3.a:0 "5 Year Plan"
  combinedsyndicates.3.b:0 "3 Year Plan"
  combinedsyndicates.3.c:0 "1 Year Plan"
  combinedsyndicates.4.t:0 "Land and agricultural reforms"
  combinedsyndicates.4.d:0 "Land and agricultural reforms were a hot button issue for the Syndicates.  Would they implement a harsh program of collectivization administered directly by the central government?  Or would they allow for local syndicates to manage farmers?  Another proposal would allow for farmers to have some guaranteed prices and also allow limited market involvement."
  combinedsyndicates.4.a:0 "Start the Collectivization process."
  combinedsyndicates.4.b:0 "Let farming be run by local syndicates."
  combinedsyndicates.4.c:0 "Have land redistribution, but with limited market involvement"
  combinedsyndicates.5.t:0 "Invitation to the Internationale"
  combinedsyndicates.5.d:0 "The Commune of France has decided that we are now ready to join the Global Syndicalist cause and many in our nation are wondering what we will do?"
  combinedsyndicates.5.a:0 "We must join arms with France"
  combinedsyndicates.5.b:0 "We must reorganize our own country"
  combinedsyndicates.6.t:0 "The CSA wants to join the Internationale"
  combinedsyndicates.6.d:0 "The Combined Syndicates of America expressed their intention to join our alliance. For the world revolution!" 
  combinedsyndicates.6.a:0 "Welcome!!"
  combinedsyndicates.7.t:0 "Emmigrants" 
  combinedsyndicates.7.d:0 "Some of The elites and the upper class of the Great Lakes have left their homes and took their families across the border to Royalist Canada."
  combinedsyndicates.7.a:0 "Close the Ambassador Bridge and Patrol the Detroit River!"
  combinedsyndicates.7.b:0 "Let The Pitiful, Isolated Individuals go where they belong!" 
  combinedsyndicates.8.t:0 "The Nationalization of the Banking System"
  combinedsyndicates.8.d:0 "The Revolution is in need of funding, and one of the ideas presented by Max Schachtman is to nationalize the banks. Shall we make this into a decree?" 
  combinedsyndicates.8.a:0 "Schachtman is right, Nationalize all the Banks!"
  combinedsyndicates.8.b:0 "We'll find other sources of money, leave the Banking System as is"
  combinedsyndicates.9.t:0 "The America First Escape"
  combinedsyndicates.9.d:0 "With his defeat, Long and the AUS leadership had escaped to South America taking with him a sizable amount of money and most of his remaining followers. Though he vowed to return, Reed and the CSA were not worried."
  combinedsyndicates.9.a:0 "They can run like cowards"
  combinedsyndicates.10.t:0 "Reed and the PSA Leadership"
  combinedsyndicates.10.d:0 "After the end of the civil war, the question of the PSA leadership was put before the CSA. The capitalist nature of the Pacific States was incompatible with the socialist nature of the CSA but it was also the thing that kept California one of the most technically adept places in America. Destroying the PSA leadership would destroy this but ensure that Reed would have full control of the industry on the West Coast."
  combinedsyndicates.10.a:0 "Purge them."
  combinedsyndicates.10.b:0 "We need them"
  combinedsyndicates.11.t:0 "US Government in Exile"
  combinedsyndicates.11.d:0 "The victory of the workers over the US government has forced them to flee from the country to Canada. The government has vowed to keep on fighting but without a firm power base there is very little chance of them making a difference."
  combinedsyndicates.11.a:0 "Ha."
  combinedsyndicates.12.t:0 "Resources From the People"
  combinedsyndicates.12.d:0 "The trade unions and workers of the CSA have given the mighty resources of the Rustbelt to the government of the people."
  combinedsyndicates.12.a:0 "Adequate"
  combinedsyndicates.13.t:0 "The Boiling Point"
  combinedsyndicates.13.d:0 "The shooting had barely started when the CSA began to disintegrate. The loose coalition of socialists began to form sides. The Totalists began to form a government in Washington and were trying to exert their authority over the country. The Syndicalists were working with the trade unions to form local councils to run the recently conquered areas and were trying to buck the central authority. The Anarchists were not interested in either system and were causing trouble throughout the country."
  combinedsyndicates.13.a:0 "Side with the Totalists"
  combinedsyndicates.13.b:0 "Side with the Anarcho-syndicalists"
  combinedsyndicates.13.c:0 "Side with the Trade Unionists"
  combinedsyndicates.14.t:0 "The Soviets of America"
  combinedsyndicates.14.d:0 "The Communist government in Washington began to spread its power by setting up soviets throughout the country. The beginnings of an egalitarian society were now ready to commence."
  combinedsyndicates.14.a:0 "Excellent!"
  combinedsyndicates.15.t:0 "The Southern Resistance"
  combinedsyndicates.15.d:0 "The Communists had brought about an immediate end to the racial segragation laws in the south. This caused an immediate flare up of racial tensions and violence. Armed group of men calling themselves the Minute Men had begun making attacks against CSA facilities and offices. They terrorized the local countryside and were reportedly responsible for more than one lynching."
  combinedsyndicates.15.a:0 "Move troops in to restore the situation."
  combinedsyndicates.15.b:0 "Hopefully the local committee can handle it."
  combinedsyndicates.16.t:0 "The South Erupts"
  combinedsyndicates.16.d:0 "The tensions of the south had been brewing since the Communist takeover and the local soviets were barely in control of the situation. Local resistance groups had been ratcheting up the tension between blacks and whites and playing on the general fear in the area. It was only a matter of time before the situation erupted into anarchy and violence."
  combinedsyndicates.16.a:0 "Uh oh!"
  combinedsyndicates.17.t:0 "Racial Violence in the South"
  combinedsyndicates.17.d:0 "The racial tension that had been at the boiling point, boiled over, and erupted into violence. Groups of whites and blacks attacked each other as the local soviets was unable to contain the issue. Tensions ran high as the South began to burn."
  combinedsyndicates.17.a:0 "Damn!"
  combinedsyndicates.18.t:0 "10 Years Since Bonnie and Clyde Passed Away"
  combinedsyndicates.18.d:0 "These two heroes did a lot of good for our nation then, as they were standing up against the capitalist government! They deserve a special day!"
  combinedsyndicates.18.a:0 "Happy Bonnie and Clyde day, mom."
  combinedsyndicates.19.t:0 "Jack Reed's Illness"
  combinedsyndicates.19.d:0 "The physical health of the Head of the Central Committee, Jack Reed, has been deteriorating for a while now, to the point that a public announcement has had to be made concerning it, as it can no longer be concealed. The exact cause of his illness is currently unknown, but the wasting effects of it are shortening his life. Whilst his passion for the revolution remains untempered, his ability to lead it may not last much longer."
  combinedsyndicates.19.a:0 "How dreadful"
  combinedsyndicates.20.t:0 "Jack Reed passes away"
  combinedsyndicates.20.d:0 "At 2314 the Head of the Central Committee, Jack Reed, after valiantly fighting for his life and his country, and having managed to live to see his dream of a Syndicalist America, has passed away. An autopsy conducted showed that he died of a brain hemorrhage that was due to complications caused by a malignant tumor in his heart."
  combinedsyndicates.20.a:0 "A Hero of Labour dies today."
  combinedsyndicates.21.t:0 "Emergency General Meeting of the Central Committee"
  combinedsyndicates.21.d:0 "Following the death of Jack Reed, the Central Committee met to decide who was to follow in his footsteps and become the head of the Central Committee and by extension the Combined Syndicates of America. After a first round of nominations it became clear there were four leading favourites."
  combinedsyndicates.21.a:0 "Earl Browder's Marxist Theory sways the vote."
  combinedsyndicates.21.b:0 "William Z. Foster's Visionary Oratory serves him well."
  combinedsyndicates.21.c:0 "Benjamin Gitlow's Practical Understanding seals the deal"
  combinedsyndicates.21.e:0 "Norman Thomas's Inoffensive Nature secures him the job."
  combinedsyndicates.22.t:0 "Appointment of a New General Secretary"
  combinedsyndicates.22.d:0 "Having come into power, Earl Browder must choose who will assist him at the helm of government."
  combinedsyndicates.22.a:0 "Paul Mattick's hardnosed approach wins favours"
  combinedsyndicates.22.b:0 "William Z. Foster's genius secures him the job"
  combinedsyndicates.22.c:0 "James W. Ford's longstanding friendship serves him well"
  combinedsyndicates.22.e:0 "Eugene Dennis's union links sweep him to power"
  combinedsyndicates.23.t:0 "Appointment of a New General Secretary"
  combinedsyndicates.23.d:0 "Having come into power, William Z. Foster faces the key decision of who is to be his right hand man."
  combinedsyndicates.23.a:0 "Bayard Rustin's unique viewpoint gets him in"
  combinedsyndicates.23.b:0 "Max Shachtman's economic programs get him the job"
  combinedsyndicates.23.c:0 "Eugene Dennis's union links sweep him to power"
  combinedsyndicates.23.e:0 "Merge the Posts! Centralisation starts here!"
  combinedsyndicates.24.t:0 "Appointment of a New General Secretary"
  combinedsyndicates.24.d:0 "Having come into power, Ben Gitlow has to figure out who will help him run the country."
  combinedsyndicates.24.a:0 "Jay Lovestone's friendship serves him well"
  combinedsyndicates.24.b:0 "Carlo Tresca's union links bring him into the fold"
  combinedsyndicates.24.c:0 "Robert M. La Follette's attitude wins him the task"
  combinedsyndicates.24.e:0 "Norman Thomas's idealism gets him the job"
  combinedsyndicates.25.t:0 "Appointment of a New General Secretary"
  combinedsyndicates.25.d:0 "Having come into power, Norman Thomas must decide who can help him with the Grand American Project."
  combinedsyndicates.25.a:0 "James P. Cannon's union links serve him well"
  combinedsyndicates.25.b:0 "Joseph P. Lash has the right credentials"
  combinedsyndicates.25.c:0 "Robert M. La Follette's attitude wins him the task"
  combinedsyndicates.25.e:0 "Carlo Tresca's economic programs get him the job"
  combinedsyndicates.26.t:0 "A Rather Public Argument"
  combinedsyndicates.26.d:0 "Despite their best efforts to work together, William Foster and his associate Max Shachtman have publically fallen out at a meeting of the Central Committee on the topic of economic policy. Foster accused Shachtman of not being willing to test the strength of the country in the name of progress. Shachtman countered that Foster's demands would have an unacceptable social cost. Ultimately a compromise was reached, but the public are aware there is discord at the highest echelon."
  combinedsyndicates.26.a:0 "How embarrassing"
  combinedsyndicates.27.t:0 "A Rather Public Argument"
  combinedsyndicates.27.d:0 "Despite their best efforts to work together, Ben Gitlow and his associate Robert La Follette have publically fallen out at a meeting of the Central Committee. Gitlow accused La Follette of being a popinjay who doesn't know what he's talking about. La Follette responded that Gitlow was an old-stiffneck with no vision. The pair of them later apologised and both blamed it on the stress of their job. Regardless the public are aware there is discord at the highest echelon."
  combinedsyndicates.27.a:0 "How embarrassing"
  combinedsyndicates.28.t:0 "Fate of Hollywood"
  combinedsyndicates.28.d:0 "With California finally under our control, we need to decide what to do with its film industry. Our leadership is divided between leaving the studios to their own devices (Barring our new film censorship and approval board) and purging the whole area and using the money to create something more useful to the state. While purging and industrializing the area would speed California's recovery, the studios make a lot of taxable money, and our citizens will be upset at the loss of entertainment."
  combinedsyndicates.28.a:0 "Leave them alone, we have enough control."
  combinedsyndicates.28.b:0 "Hollywood belongs to its workers!"
  combinedsyndicates.28.c:0 "Purge the area and build something useful!"
  combinedsyndicates.29.t:0 "Minutemen!"
  combinedsyndicates.29.d:0 "Founded by former capitalists whose property was expropiated and nationalized following the revolution, militant liberals and conservatives alike have been roaming the countryside causing chaos wherever they go. This time they killed the leader of a local Trade Union!"
  combinedsyndicates.29.a:0 "They shall be brought to justice."
  combinedsyndicates.30.t:0 "Trade Union builds up rail network"
  combinedsyndicates.30.d:0 "A Trade Union in one of our communities has just recently finished construction of a new railroad line in the area."
  combinedsyndicates.30.a:0 "Magnificent!"
  combinedsyndicates.43.t:0 "The CSA and New England"
  combinedsyndicates.43.d:0 "A level of stability had returned to the countryside in America. The CSA government had turned its attention to the small state of New England. New England had been propped up by its masters in the Entente but now the CSA government looked to reintegrate the state into the CSA but there was a possibility that it could lead to war with the Entente."
  combinedsyndicates.43.a:0 "Demand the surrender of New England"
  combinedsyndicates.43.b:0 "Not worth a war"
  combinedsyndicates.31.t:0 "The CSA Demands New England"
  combinedsyndicates.31.d:0 "The CSA government demanded the full integration of New England into the CSA. Without the support of Canada, New England would not be able to resist the CSA and would surely capitulate. A refusal of the CSA demands would lead to war with the CSA and possibly all of the syndicate nations."
  combinedsyndicates.31.a:0 "We stand with our friends"
  combinedsyndicates.31.b:0 "They are on their own"
  combinedsyndicates.32.t:0 "New England Stands Alone"
  combinedsyndicates.32.d:0 "The Canadian government had abandoned New England to the CSA. There were only two options."
  combinedsyndicates.32.a:0 "We cannot resist the CSA"
  combinedsyndicates.32.b:0 "To hell with the CSA"
  combinedsyndicates.33.t:0 "New England Endgame"
  combinedsyndicates.33.d:0 "New England has surrendered to our demands."
  combinedsyndicates.33.a:0 "Endgame"
  combinedsyndicates.34.t:0 "New England Refuses to Surrender"
  combinedsyndicates.34.d:0 "The fools in New England have refused to surrender to the CSA. The government of the people is demanding war to destroy the small nation and make the American mainland whole."
  combinedsyndicates.34.a:0 "They will rue this day"
  combinedsyndicates.34.b:0 "War is not the answer"
  combinedsyndicates.35.t:0 "The CSA Demand"
  combinedsyndicates.35.d:0 "The Entente has backed the people of New England against the threat of the CSA. With this assurance, most of the people in New England are willing to fight for their independence."
  combinedsyndicates.35.a:0 "We will resist to the end"
  combinedsyndicates.35.b:0 "We will give in"
  combinedsyndicates.36.t:0 "The Pacific Question"
  combinedsyndicates.36.d:0 "The CSA had been victorious in the war and now was forced to deal with the PSA. The Pacific States were rich in resources and the government was unfriendly to the CSA so removing that threat was an option but some less radical elements believed that the CSA had been at war enough and that a further war would put unnecessary strain on the delicate hold the government had."
  combinedsyndicates.36.a:0 "War will end this!"
  combinedsyndicates.36.b:0 "We should try and coexist with neighbours."
  combinedsyndicates.37.t:0 "The Reed Doctrine"
  combinedsyndicates.37.d:0 "With the Combined Syndicates of America firmly established, defeating the capitalist oppressors in Central and South America is necessary to ensure the security of the new state. A strong position would allow for intervention against the capitalists before they could successfully strengthen their positions in the Western hemisphere. Some were concerned that the CSA was spreading itself thin and that internal issues should be addressed first."
  combinedsyndicates.37.a:0 "Reactionaries must be stopped."
  combinedsyndicates.37.b:0 "America first."
  combinedsyndicates.38.t:0 "The Reed Doctrine"
  combinedsyndicates.38.d:0 "The Combined Syndicates of America have proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing capitalism throughout the Americas.  Such a policy is an obvious threat to Mexico."
  combinedsyndicates.38.a:0 "A new threat arises"
  combinedsyndicates.39.t:0 "The Reed Doctrine"
  combinedsyndicates.39.d:0 "The Combined Syndicates of America have proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing capitalism throughout the Americas.  Such a policy is an obvious threat to La-Plata."
  combinedsyndicates.39.a:0 "A new threat arises"
  combinedsyndicates.40.t:0 "The Reed Doctrine"
  combinedsyndicates.40.d:0 "The Combined Syndicates of America have proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing Ccpitalism throughout the Americas.  Such a policy is an obvious threat to Honduras."
  combinedsyndicates.40.a:0 "A new threat arises"
  combinedsyndicates.41.t:0 "The Reed Doctrine"
  combinedsyndicates.41.d:0 "The Combined Syndicates of America have proclaimed a policy aimed at extinguishing capitalism throughout the Americas.  Such a policy is an obvious threat to United Provinces."
  combinedsyndicates.41.a:0 "A new threat arises"
  combinedsyndicates.42.t:0 "The Mexican Question"
  combinedsyndicates.42.d:0 "With territory of the former USA under our firm control, time has come to directly implement the Reed doctrine and eradicate capitalism from America. We should start with our southern neighbour-Mexico. The incompetence of the previous governments allowed capitalism to root deeply within Mexican society. The only way to solve this matter is direct military confrontation..."
  combinedsyndicates.42.a:0 "War will end this!"
  combinedsyndicates.42.b:0 "We should try and coexist with our neighbours."
