On the other hand, a 'nativist' clique has emerged, supporting the claims of Don Fernando de Teruel, current holder of the Spanish title of Duke of Moctezuma de Tultengo - thus, a descendent of Aztec emperor Moctezuma II."

mexico.89.t:0 "Mexico wants Southern Arizona"
mexico.89.d:0 "The Mexican government has made a proposal to us: despite our threats, they still insist on keeping Southern Arizona - the sparselly-populated lands of the Gadsden Purchase, the last territory transfered from Mexico to the US, back in 1853. Those territories, centered on the town of Tucson, have a very small population of no more than 40.000 and little to no natural resources - thus, accepting Mexican rule over that tiny strip of territory could be a small price to pay to avoid another war. On the other hand, however, most of our population wouldn't even accept the idea of our government handing territory containing tens of thousands of American nationals to another country!
mexico.89.a:0 "Accept the Mexican proposal, it's quite reasonable"
mexico.89.b:0 "Refuse, it is rightful American territory"

mexico.90.d:0 "The stubborn Mexicans have made a proposal to us: despite our threats, they still insist on keeping Southern Arizona (the lands of the Gadsden Purchase, the last territory transfered from Mexico to the US, back in 1853), plus the sparsely populated far-western part of Texas, beyond the Pecos river, centered on El Paso County (the so-called Trans-Pecos zone). Given that those territories are part of the Chihuahan Desert, with a very small population and little to no natural resources, it could be a small price to pay to avoid another war. On the other hand, however, most of our population wouldn't even accept the idea of our government handing territory containing tens of thousands of American nationals to another country!"

mexico.91.d:0 "The stubborn Mexicans have made a daring proposal to us: despite our threats, they still insist on keeping Southern Arizona (the lands of the Gadsden Purchase, the last territory transferred from Mexico to the U.S. back in 1853), plus the heavily populated western part of Texas, including key cities such as Austin, San Antonio and Corpus Christi!"
mexico.91.a:0 "Accept their proposal"
mexico.91.b:0 "They must be crazy, refuse this proposal"
mexico.92.t:0 "The U.S. accept our proposal"
mexico.92.d:0 "The U.S. government has accepted our proposal to partition the disputed territories. We may have once again lost an enormous part of our ancestral land, but at least we have spared our people from the horrors of total war against los estadounidenses."
