rusd.3.t:0 "Failure of a Bombing Plot"
rusd.3.d:0 "The Anarchists, Socialists, Syndicalists and Bolsheviks are weakening the stability of our Motherland.

rusd.4.t:0 "Peasant Unrest"
rusd.4.d:0  "Throughout Russian history the peasants' living conditions has always been hard, even during periods of peace and prosperity. Even the emancipation reforms of 1861, which led to the abolition of serfdom, did not improve the situation all that much. Local peasant protests against their grim position, as well as landowners' illegal actions, were common."
rusd.4.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.5.t:0 "Agitation in the Countryside"
rusd.5.d:0 "With the situation in the countryside growing increasingly unstable the peasants became easy to influence by various agitators.

rusd.5.b:0 "Eliminate the agitator!"

rusd.6.t:0 "Major Peasant Unrest"
rusd.6.d:0 "Agitated by various groups, the impoverished peasantry has risen up.

rusd.6.a:0 "Send the army to eliminate the threat!"
rusd.6.b:0 "Attempt to negotiate and fulfill some of their demands."

rusd.7.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.8.t:0 "Workers' Strike"
rusd.8.d:0  "Some workers in one of our cities have organised themselves and began to strike, completely disrupting all industrial production within the city. They demand higher salaries and enforcement of labour regulations preventing unfair treatment of the workforce."

rusd.8.c:0 "Send in the army to pacify them!"

rusd.9.b:0 "Reach an agreement, but keep the reforms to a minimum."
rusd.9.c:0 "Reach a thorough agreement."

rusd.10.t:0 "Harsh Measures"
rusd.10.d:0 "The commander of a local army garrison has proposed that we use brute force in order to disperse the strikers and force them to go back to work."
rusd.10.a:0 "Why not? It's quicker than those negotiations!"
rusd.10.b:0 "No, we must not be too harsh."

rusd.11.t:0 "The Strikers give up!"
rusd.11.d:0 "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The workers, seeing little success in their efforts, are about to call off the strike."
rusd.11.a:0 "Splendid!"

rusd.12.t:0 "The Factory returns to Work"
rusd.12.d:0 "With the crisis resolved, the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
rusd.12.a:0 "Excellent!"

rusd.13.t:0 "General Strike"
rusd.13.d:0 "Workers organisations all over the Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike.

rusd.14.t:0 "General Strike expands"

rusd.38.t:0 "Status of the Orthodox Church"
rusd.38.d:0 "The Orthodox Church, under the leadership of the vocal Patriarch Kirill, is demanding a clarification of its legal status in the Russian Republic. He wants us to pass a constitutional amendment on the issue of our national religion."

rusd.39.t:0 "The Clergy criticises our Government"
rusd.39.d:0 "A number of priests have voiced their disagreement with our policy of a secular and modern state. Even though this fact has little importance, we must keep in mind that religion plays a huge role in common people's lives."
rusd.39.a:0 "Progress cannot be stopped!"

rusd.40.t:0 "The Patriarch criticises our Government"
rusd.40.d:0 "Seeing increased displeasure amongst the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state.

rusd.44.a:0 "A harmless, yet useful ceremony!"

rusd.45.d:0 "A small celebration dedicated to the prosperity of our Motherland has been performed yesterday in one of our towns.

Many common people consider this to be a visible sign of the Church's support for the Motherland."
rusd.45.a:0 "S nami Bog!"

rusd.46.d:0 "A large scale celebration has taken place is our capital. Apart from thousands of common Russians, the Patriarch, members of the Romanov family and dozens of nobles, politicians and high-ranking officers have attended the mass.

rusd.47.t:0 "Prayers for the Tsar"

rusd.48.t:0 "The Liberals criticise the Clergy"
rusd.48.d:0 "It seems that the liberal elements of our society consider it rather unwise to maintain such strong bonds between the Church and the state. During a small demonstration in the capital, they have demanded more religious pluralism and secularisation of the government."
rusd.48.a:0 "Let them shout!"

rusd.50.t:0 "The Prime Minister Addresses the Duma"
rusd.50.d:0 "After Kerensky's assassination the country is still in chaos. Although the Duma managed to maintain the mantle of legislative and executive power, the government's control of the apparatus of state is still unstable. In an attempt to restore popular faith in parliament, the Prime Minister today held a speech in a packed Duma, stressing the importance of maintaining both order and the civil liberties of all the Russian Federation's citizens"

rusd.51.t:0 "Marshal Denikin Addresses the Nation"

rusd.52.t:0 "The Patriarch's Demands"

rusd.59.t:0 "Kirill Romanov is dead"
rusd.59.d:0 "The Romanov pretender, Kirill Romanov, has died. His son Vladimir is in his early twenties and may make an excellent and pliable figurehead as Tsar. Perhaps now it is time to restore the Monarchy?"
rusd.59.a:0 "Yes, a new Tsar shall promote order and stability!"
rusd.59.b:0 "No. The Tsarist system shall never rise again."

rusd.61.t:0 "The IX Duma Elections"
rusd.61.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. Although Kerensky's assassination caused major turmoil in Russia, the VIII Duma has managed to wait out the storm and elections should proceed without interruption. But who will triumph?"

rusd.65.d:0 "According to our constitution a new President should be elected after Kerensky's assasination. However, political turmoil has caused a delay in the procedure and elections could proceed only after the IX Duma was chosen. Now the time has come to settle the one final dispute in our government. Who should the Senate choose to lead the country?"
rusd.65.a:0 "Viktor Chernov, leader of the SR Party."
rusd.65.b:0 "Vasily Maklakov, the Kadet-Liberal representative."
rusd.65.c:0 "Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov, an aristocratic candidate."
rusd.65.e:0 "Solomon Lozovsky! A modern people's tribune!"

rusd.66.t:0 "SR-Menshevik Coalition breaks up"
rusd.66.d:0 "Kerensky's death meant that the fragile SR-Kadet coalition was no more. Even though the SR-Menshevik coalition has resulted in the two parties gaining considerable influence in the government, ideological differences between the two parties were too great to maintain a coherent coalition, resulting in the Mensheviks leaving the government. This gives way to great possibilities, including a Menshevik-Bolshevik coalition in the near future."
rusd.66.a:0 "Let the Reds quarrel!"
rusd.66.b:0 "Oh no!"

rusd.67.t:0 "Splintering within the Conservatives"
rusd.67.d:0 "Dmitri Romanov's authority and charisma was one of the few things that kept the Russian conservatives strong and vibrant. With his death, the movement quickly split into two branches; the so-called Siloviki, organised around marshal Denikin and consisting mostly of White military officers, and the conservative Civilians, gathered around professor Nikolai Trubetskoy. Without his protector, Yusupov was quickly replaced by Trubetskoy."
rusd.67.a:0 "Let them quarrel!"

rusd.68.t:0 "The X Duma Elections"
rusd.68.d:0  "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The IX Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. With the conservatives and left-wing forces in disarray, these elections may lead to surprising results."
rusd.68.a:0 "The Kadet-Liberal Coalition."

rusd.71.b:0 "The Mensheviks."
rusd.71.c:0 "The Menshevik-Bolshevik Coalition."

rusd.76.d:0 "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The IX Duma's term has expired and the time has come to elect a new parliament. However, many orthodox Bolsheviks see the Duma as an unneccessary obstacle in building the Communist state. The right-wing sympathizers within the Army are also a problem."
rusd.76.a:0 "Dissolve the Duma and place loyal officers in the Army!"
rusd.76.b:0 "Compromise with the Mensheviks and SR."
rusd.76.c:0 "The Kadets, liberals, and royalists overthrow the Bolsheviks!"

rusd.78.d:0 "A combined front of Kadets, liberals, and monarchists has managed to topple the Bolshevik republic and restore the monarchy under Vladimir Romanov. What kind of monarchy should it be?"

rusd.78.b:0 "An autocratic monarchy."

rusd.90.c:0 "Another faction prevails."

rusd.95.t:0 "The Presidental Elections of 1949"

rusd.96.t:0 "Anton Denikin dies"
rusd.96.d:0 "A Hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true Heroes of Russia. Grand Admiral Vasily Kanin has been selected to replace him as the head of the Siloviki."
rusd.96.a:0 "Goodbye, Denikin"
rusd.96.b:0 "Even the strongest die one day!"

rusd.961.t:0 "Anton Denikin's Succession"
rusd.961.d:0 "With Denikin's death, many pathways are open for Russia. The legal pretender Vladimir Romanov awaits for a chance to assume power and restore her legitimate dynasty, while liberal movements argue for a restoration of the republic. "

rusd.98.t:0 "Pyotr Struve dies"
rusd.98.d:0 "A great liberal and a proponent of the democratic system in Russia, Pyotr B. Struve, has passed away. A member of the Kadet Party and a skilled politician before, during and after the Civil War, Struve shall be remembered as one of the greatest patriots in our history."

rusd.101.t:0 "Vladimir Purishkevich dies"
rusd.101.d:0 "A notable figure of the conservative movement, and perhaps the last true landowner in Russia has died yesterday in his rural estate. It is feared that his death may cause a great reshuffling on the right side of the political scene."

rusd.103.d:0  "Our beloved Tsar has died yesterday due to tuberculosis. In his last will and testament, Dmitri II expressed a desire for his son, Pavel, to inherit the crown. However, the young Tsarevich is only 12 so the Prime Minister would have to act as regent until Pavel II comes of age. This means that anti-monarchic elements in the government are likely to make an attempt to overthrow the monarchy and reestablish a republic. Besides, there is the legitimite pretender Vladimir waiting for his chance."

rusd.106.t:0 "Maxim Gorky dies"
rusd.106.d:0 "Russian writer Alexei Maximovich Peshkov, better known under his pen name Maxim Gorky, died today in Moscow at 68. A fellow traveler of the Bolsheviks, he experienced oppression under the Tsarist regime but was quite doubtful during the October Revolution, thus avoiding reprisals after the Civil War. A rabid opponent of Kerensky, he publicly supported Bukharin. As he narrowly followed his son in death many think that his sudden death could be due to the changing political atmosphere in Russia."
