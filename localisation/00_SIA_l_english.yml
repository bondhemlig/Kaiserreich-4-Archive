siam.22.b:0 "One of the problem solved"
siam.22.c:0 "As long as we fight, we shall never fall!"
siam.23.t:0 "The Fall of Bangkok"

Several local [SIA.GetAdjective] leaders have been offered seppuku, to atone for their failure and due to the possibility of resistance rallying around them, the offer was not voluntary.

Now, with the last of the organized defenses stamped out and the [SIA.GetAdjective] army surrendering or desperately attempting to retreat, it seems that [SIA.GetNameDef] is likely to capitulate soon enough."

The epicentre is believed to be near the Grand Palace, destroying centuries worth of cultural artifacts including the Emerald Buddha. \n\n[From.Owner.GetLeader] has nevertheless been confirmed to have survived and is preparing a rousing speech for the radio later today. Much of the city is beyond recognition with the old city completely levelled to the ground, but the Golden Pagoda seem to have survived the blast better than expected. It has been decided that it should stand untouched forever as a monument to the city's resilience."
nuke_dropped.14.a:0 "Does this mean the end of the [SIA.GetAdjective] independence?"
