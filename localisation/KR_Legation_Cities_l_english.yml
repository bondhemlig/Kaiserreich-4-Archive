legcities.16.t:0 "Results of conference"
legcities.16.d:0 "Although the conference itself was a success, the result is harsh. Delegates agreed with the AOG's opinion that its occupation of Chinese ports will provide the best protection of foreign investments, which means that the Legation Cities will remain occupied by the AOG."
legcities.16.a:0 "Drat!"

legcities.17.t:0 "Results of conference"
legcities.17.d:0 "All major participants of the Tokyo conference have reached an agreement about the future status of the Legation cities.

legcities.22.d:0 "Following the 1926 German Intervention in China and the Treaty of Nanjing signed in November of that year, foreign trade was left to the richest cities of the coast, under a joint control of world powers owning interests in China. The independence of these consortium of cities was guaranteed by ten powers; Australasia, Austria, Canada, Flanders-Wallonia, Germany, Italy, Japan, National France, Russia and USA. Foreign investments and Legation Cities themselves flourish not only through foreign trade but also thanks to smuggling into AllgOstAsien and Qing territories.

legcities.28.t:0 "Seize foreign investments?"
legcities.28.d:0 "Our armed forces have seized control over the rich and industrialised Legation cities with its large foreign investments.

legcities.42.d:0 "Following the 1926 German Intervention in China and the Treaty of Nanjing signed in November of that year, foreign trade was left to the richest cities of the coast, under a joint control of world powers owning interests in China. The independence of these consortium of cities was guaranteed by the major local and international powers, such as the Qing Empire, AllgOstAsien GmbH, Japan, Australia, Canada, United States and Germany. Foreign investments and Legation Cities themselves flourish not only through foreign trade but also thanks to smuggling into AllgOstAsien and Qing territories. Though Russia didn't have the investments in the Legation Cities after the Weltkrieg, but now is a perfect time to get our part of the Chinese markets!"
