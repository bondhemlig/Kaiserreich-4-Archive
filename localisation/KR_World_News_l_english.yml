worldnews.1.t:0 "The Second American Civil War"
worldnews.1.d:0 "To uneducated foreigners, it might seem like the crisis in the United States happened out of nowhere, but experts agree that this was a civil war years in making. Ever since the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange in 1925, the economy of the United States has been in constant downturn. \nNow, the United States has devolved into a three-way civil war between the loyalists of the old government, the syndicalist Combined Syndicates of America and the conservative and xenophobic American Union State. There have already been reports of arriving volunteers from Europe to fight for a faction of their liking. The Second American Civil War might just be the first of the many battlefields between the great powers of the world in this tough time for humanity."

This is a victory for the French government, which had already declared the acquisition of Romandie another victory of the world's working class."

worldnews.3.d:0 "Mere 20 years ago, in the last years of the Weltkrieg, the Russian Empire collapsed in turmoil, ripped apart between nationalist movements, the Whites and the Reds. After a German intervention, the republican government defeated the Bolsheviks, but it appears that the Russian revolutionary spirit was not extinguished. \n\nAfter ineffective land reform by the Kerensky government and austerity measures to pay off the Brest-Litovsk reparations, as well as a crisis in the government after the President's assassination, the cities in the western part of the nation have been engulfed with the Red tide once more. Will Bukharin's Soviet Russia prevail, or will the loyalists of the White government defeat the dissenters a second time?"

worldnews.4.d:0 "Ever since the defeat of Napoleon, Spain has been plagued by violence, dissent and turmoil, but it appears that these tensions have reached a breaking point. That is, the Spanish kingdom has been ripped apart in a three-sided civil war between numerous factions - the loyalists of the Madrid government, the supporters of the pretender Javier and finally the anarcho-syndicalist party known as the CNT-FAI. There are already numerous reports of volunteers and equipment being shipped to Spain from all over the world to support one faction or another. \n\nIt can be safely said that the fields and mountains of Spain will be the first battlefield of a much wider conflict between the left and the right..."

worldnews.5.d:0 "The Weltkrieg is universally agreed to have been the most horrible war in human existence, but it appears that even the greatest nightmares cannot deter man's lust for blood. After numerous political struggles and periods of diplomatic tension, the uneasy peace between Germany and France has broken down. These two superpowers are now mobilising their armies and preparing for a conflict never before seen to the human eye. \n\nThe military developments of the Interwar will be put to the ultimate test. New types of weapons, planes, artillery, ships and tanks will see their first usage in the battlefield. But who will emerge victorious? That is a question none can answer."

worldnews.6.d:0 "German spies have recently revealed a mysterious, and in some ways horrifying project taken up by the French and British. Dubbed 'The Damocles Project', it is an extensive multi-nation study into the destructive power of nuclear fission, seeking to unearth any possible... weaponisation possibilities of this phenomena. The famous German physicist Albert Einstein warns that a successful 'nuclear bomb' might even be able to turn entire cities into ash. \n\nGerman intelligence agencies have shared the information about this project to their closest allies, but most of the world is still left unaware of it. However, experts disagree on whether this weapon is feasible or if this is just science fiction gone too far."

Plagued by disorder, conflict and ineffective governments, the Republic lost the support of the people, and Russian agencies now report that a successor of Nicholas II has been finally coronated as the new Tsar of the nation. \n\nWhile it is not known how different the international stance of this reborn Russian Empire will be, or even if the coronation of the Tsar will have any effect in 'saving the country', numerous monarchies across the world have already congratulated the Romanovs on regaining their divine birth right."

The government of the Russian nation has announced their territorial ambitions, laying claims on almost all the territory of the former Russian Empire. And it appears they are willing to reconquer the lost land if necessary. \n\nNumerous nations in Eastern Europe have already recalled their embassies in Russia, and the world is waiting for Germany's response to this blatant attack on her sphere of influence..."

The French opened the International with a powerful parade, festivities in Paris and finally a speech by the Chairman of the CSP. \n\nTopics like Spain, the United States and the world economic crisis are at the top priority, and it's expected that France and Britain will take initiative in the gathering."

The Mongolian army has already defeated the Ma Clique and von Sternberg has declared his right to reign over all Mongolians numerous times before.

The Union of Britain has declared its goal of spreading Syndicalism to the nearby state of Ireland, which prompted an intervention by the exiled British royalist government in Canada. The navies and air forces of both belligerents are already being mobilised, and the first shots have already been fired in the Irish Sea. \n\nExperts believe that the intensity of this conflict will be limited due to the large bodies of water separating the belligerents, but it has nevertheless raised world tensions to new heights."

worldnews.13.t:0 "E.M. Remark - A Third Reich"
worldnews.13.d:0 "The famous German writer and member of the Lost Generation of poets, Erich Maria Remark, has released a new book, the first major work of alternate history in the German Empire. \n\nThe story is a gripping tale about the life of a young Weltkrieg veteran trying to live in a shell-shocked and defeated Germany. In this timeline, Theodore Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party win the 1912 American presidential elections, leading to an American entry in the Weltkrieg and thus an Entente victory. A defeated and partially occupied Germany is gripped by constant economic and political crises, witnesses the defeat of the Whites in the Russian Civil War and is couped by a bitter and extremely nationalist Adam Dressler and his German Workers Party, who follow the ideology of 'People's Socialism', which is just an extreme version of National Populism. \n\nThe novel ends with the beginning of a three-sided war between Dressler's 'New Reich', the Western Entente and a Soviet Russia led by Sergey Kirov. While many criticise it for large flaws in historical logic, Remark defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

#worldnews.14.t:0 "Ignas Šeinius - The Red Flood"
#worldnews.14.d:0 "Ignas Šeinius, Lithuania's most famous impressionist writer, has recently published a new book, 'Raudonasis tvanas' (The Red Flood) that has just breached Lithuania's prison in literary obscurity. \n\nMuch like his famous 'Kuprelis', The Red Flood is a gripping impressionist tale about a love story between two young individuals in a divided country, but what is must interesting is the setting of the story. The novel takes place in an alternate timeline where the Brusilov Offensive was successful and knocked Austria-Hungary out of the Weltkrieg in 1916. This leads to a chain of events that result in an Entente victory. Germany is engulfed by revolution and becomes a Syndicalist nation, while Russia is coup by Kolchak, supported by the Black Hundreds, and becomes a totalitarian ultra-nationalist dictatorship. Europe is soon embroiled into war once more, and Lithuania becomes a front line, a bloodbath between the Germans and Russians, where even the strongest men perish and die in minutes. The end of the novel hints at a possible Russian breakthrough, as well as a naval invasion by the British Empire... \n\nThe book has been criticised for horrid descriptions of cruelty and war crimes, but Šeinius defends his tale, saying that 'something like this could have happened in another Universe'."

Despite his massive unpopularity among the Russian people due to botched land reform and ineffective rule, Kerensky was nevertheless able to hold the country together for years, and his death has thrown Russia into chaos. The Senators are already discussing a possible replacement to Kerensky, new coalitions are being formed, both between the left and the right, while military men like Denikin, Wrangel and Kornilov are just one step away from intervening to dissolve democracy and 'save Mother Russia'..."

worldnews.16.d:0 "After the Great South American War of the 1930s, two regional powers emerged in South America - Brazil and Argentina, the latter of whom later evolved into the 'federation' of La Plata. Tensions between these two giants, former enemies in the War now turned rivals for South American domination, have been rising for years, and a La Platan victory against Paraguay and Bolivia did little to ease them. \n\nThe fragile peace in South America has been finally broken with the beginning of an outright war between the two countries, a war that the weakened US will probably not be able to stop. While La Platans are confident in a second victory, Brazilians are ready to achieve revenge for their defeat last time..."

worldnews.17.t:0 "The Arab Congress"
worldnews.17.d:0 "The Arab Revolt in the Weltkrieg was a failure, mostly due to the defeat of the Entente, and the millions of Arabs living in the Levant and Iraq stayed under Ottoman rule. Despite this, though, Arab nationalism has been on the rise for many years, and it has finally culminated in the beginning of the Arab Congress in Cairo. Representatives from numerous Arabic nations were greeted with a spectacular performance by Egyptian dancers and an artillery salute, and the negotiations began. \n\nExperts predict that Egypt and Hashemite Arabia will lead the Congress, a Congress where bitterness towards the Ottomans and sometimes even discussions of a united Arab 'axis' against the Turks can flow freely."

While this pact puts a lot of focus on cultural discussion and preserving Balkan identities, it is also a military alliance between the participants, seemingly directed at the country separating them and holding their 'ancestral lands'. \n\nThis new development is a big thorn in Bulgarian domination of the Balkans, but only the incoming reaction of the other Central Powers can determine whether it will yield any fruit."

However, the Afghani government's attempts to modernise over the last decades have been met with fierce resistance from the conservative elements within the country. King Amanullah Khan now hopes to use the turmoil in Delhi following the death of George V to his advantage. By repeating the success of the Fourth Anglo-Afghan War, the king hopes to silence the conservative opposition and bring new lands to the crown. However, international experts do not put many hopes on the tiny mountain nation winning this conflict."

The chain of command fell like a house of cards, and every chief, officers and king in the territory now has no one above him, besides a vague notion that the Kaiser still protects Africa. As the central goverment no longer can act, conflict spaks across the continent as the various Kingdoms, Tribes and Protectorates that comprised it now fight amongst themselves over new claims and ancient grudges, and cliques of askari and german colonial officers attempt to keep a semblance of normality. Whether this state of affairs is passing, or a dark age of violence is truly beginning in Africa, it is uncertain. However, its safe to say thay the colonial mission of the German Empire has failed."

Most building along the Ratchadamnoen road were ruined by the artillery barrage, and the Union Jack is now raised over what is left of the old Ananta Samakhom throne hall that was used by the [old_controller.GetAdjective] government as their parliament.\n\nThe [old_controller.GetAdjective] government has met to discuss [new_controller.GetAdjective] demands, with many of Seri Thai movement members now taking their pre-arranged provisional government positions, as most old cabinet members are now presumed to be dead. Outside the city, however, fighting still continues, though it is unknown just how long it will last."
worldnews.270.d.jap:0 "As fighting dies down in Bangkok, the hinomaru already flies from every building across Bangkok, now renamed Bankoku, and [new_controller.GetAdjective] officials have already installed a new transitional administration to handle their conquest.\n\nAlready, dissenters have been gathered up and driven off in the middle of the night, and the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army units who surrendered have begun a march to new camps being built for them in the countryside. Several local [old_controller.GetAdjective] leaders have been offered seppuku, to atone for their failure and due to the possibility of resistance rallying around them. Bangkok's Grand Palace has already begun renovations to be one of the Emperor's new seasonal residences, even though fighting still continues in the countryside."

worldnews.271.d:0 "The last time Moscow was taken by a foreign power, a vast fire wiped out large portions of the city. Not so today, when [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces broke through the siege lines in multiple places and converged on the Kremlin. [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers continue to snipe the enemy from highrises, but the main defences have broken and are filtering out through the suburbs into the surrounding forest.\n\nRed square, long the centre of [old_controller.GetAdjective] life in the city, has been turned into a makeshift POW camp, and burning debris was seen falling from the Kremlin windows, no doubt a last ditch effort to prevent [old_controller.GetAdjective] intelligence from falling into [new_controller.GetAdjective] hands. This is a dark day for [old_controller.GetNameDef]."

[old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders initially held back the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army across the Neva river, but a few days ago those positions finally fell. Now, sustained cannon fire on Vasilyevsky island has put the last defenders out of their misery. Some military tacticians say that, with proper defence, the city could have held out for years, but the [new_controller.GetAdjective] momentum carried them through the city far faster than that.\n\nThe [new_controller.GetAdjective] army's soldiers are using the Palace Square as a staging ground for moving throughout the rest of the city, and there are rumours of [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers taking celebratory tours through the great Museum of Artillery, confident they will put their own mark on the military history of [old_controller.GetNameDef]."

worldnews.273.d:0 "Bad news for [old_controller.GetNameDef] today as the [new_controller.GetAdjective] army has just completed its assault upon the ancient capital. While initial reports suggested the [old_controller.GetAdjective] defenders would be able to hold them at the bridges in a protracted siege, the many avenues over the river proved too much to hold. With [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops on either side of the river and scattered defenders surrendering on the isles, Kiev has fallen to the invaders.\n\nWith the thriving hub now in [new_controller.GetAdjective] hands, the rest of [old_controller.GetAdjective] lands are in jeopardy. While [new_controller.GetNameDef] has promised to respect the 700 years of history built up since the Mongols destroyed it in 1204, Kievan memory is long.

Despite the city's immensely defensible position, the [old_controller.GetAdjective] garrison could not prevent the Catete Palace and most of the city proper from falling into [new_controller.GetAdjective] hands. While fighting lingers in the hills and forests, regular [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces have been driven out, and the battle is over.\n\nMuch of Rio was damaged by the fighting, with [new_controller.GetAdjective] shells destroying the dome of Candelária Church, and the Real Grandeza Tunnel being collapsed by desperate [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers to halt the [new_controller.GetAdjective] advance. With [new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers garrisoning almost every street, and columns parading on the city centre, it's clear that [new_controller.GetNameDef] has taken a major step in its war against [old_controller.GetNameDef]."

With the raising of the [new_controller.GetAdjective] flag over El Morro Castle, commonly depicted in many postcards, the control of the entrance to the Havana harbour has been secured by the invaders. [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces, while not as numerous or well-equipped as their enemy, managed to force a brutal fight as they fought block by block against efforts by the forces of [new_controller.GetNameDef] to take the city for as long as they could. In the end, their valiant resistance was only fleeting, as Havana is now in the hands of a foreign power."

For days, [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops had fought through the suburbs, and while some of the swampy areas were still under [old_controller.GetAdjective] control, the major highway through the centre of Rome and the Vatican city was completely locked down. [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers have been seeing dispersing into the low foothills surrounding the ancient capital of the Roman Empire.\n\n[new_controller.GetNameDef] has been careful to announce that special military police are on hand in the city to prevent the looting of Saint Peter's Basicilica and the Pantheon, and they are in negotiation with the Pope to see what autonomy the Vatican can retain while under [new_controller.GetAdjective] occupation."

Now the city is completely controlled by [new_controller.GetNameDef], its many artists and musicians living in apprehension of what will become of this cultural bastion of Europe.\n\n[new_controller.GetNameDef] is planning a great military parade around the Ringstrasse in celebration of this massive military feat, and the [new_controller.GetAdjective] general in charge of the occupation is going to address citizens from the balcony off of Neue Burg to try to ease the worries of a population worn by weeks of fighting."

With rail lines into and out of the city thoroughly cut, the remaining [old_controller.GetAdjective] forces quickly thinned as deserting soldiers melted into the urban population\n\nWhile [new_controller.GetAdjective] colours now fly over Tiannanmen Gate, the flames at Zhengyangmen send towering columns of thick black smoke into the sky, its sad symbolism lost on few among the war-weary population. China can only hope that the city's new occupiers, one of many since the turn of the century, will finally restore some modicum of peace and order."

Despite the city's international protections, the victory came somewhat easily, as Shanghai's police forces and limited garrison could put up little resistance against a real army. The general population barely resisted themselves, and their non-cooperation cannot have aided already bare-bones defences.\n\nThe international city's future now seems unclear, as while unification will undoubtedly solve a great many social concerns, its prosperity has always been built on the backs of trade and foreign investment. Uncertainty reigns, and the futures of the city's foreign residents are also in doubt."
worldnews.279.d.other:0 "Despite the city's nominal international protections, [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops seized Shanghai today, rapidly overwhelming the local police and garrison forces, and raising their banners across the Bund. Only a few years ago, such an action would almost certainly be met by international outrage, but rising tensions and outright conflict elsewhere have left few able to offer meaningful protection to the [old_controller.GetNameDef] people.\n\n[new_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers have already begun the process of looting the areas outside the old International Settlement, and taking other liberties with the residents, while most foreigners are thus far left unscathed but not without worry. Uncertainty reigns, as the city's prosperity has long been built upon its reputation as a safe and stable centre for commerce."

There was hope after the Weltkrieg of renewal but, alas, fate has not been kind, as the [old_controller.GetAdjective] army collapsed trying to defend the city from both sides of the Vistula river from advancing [new_controller.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nIn a bitter twist to old memories, the Royal Castle in Warsaw has been plundered again by [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers before they fled the city, according to [new_controller.GetNameDef]. [old_controller.GetNameDef] hotly contests this, claiming [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops ransacked the Palace after heavy fighting.

Even worse, military experts predict this could be the beginning of the end of [old_controller.GetNameDef], as the loss of such a vital city is a tough blow to bear."

As of today, the general in charge of the [new_controller.GetAdjective] occupation was sighted entering the National Palace to negotiate with the governor for a ceasefire.\n\nRumours claim [new_controller.GetAdjective] troops are touring the old Aztec ruins and picking up 'free' souvenirs for themselves, and now it looks like the survivors of Spanish tyranny will learn to live under the yoke of [new_controller.GetNameDef] control."

Fierceful fights have taken place between [new_controller.GetAdjective] and [old_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers especially in the popular European district of Bab-El-Oued and in the famous Notre-Dame-D'Afrique Basilica but finally at dawn most of the city had fallen and the last pockets of resistance were getting eliminated in the Casbah.
