 ENG_tuc:0 "The 1936 Congress of the Trade Unions"
 ENG_tuc_desc:0 "This years' TUC will probably be a bit special - long-time Chairman Philip Snowden has indicated that he intends to resign. The decentralisationist Autonomists, led by Niclas y Glais, centralizationist Maximists (Oswald Mosley) and Status Quo Federationists (Arthur Horner) with his egalitarian & pacifist running mate Annie Kenney are all vying for superiority. These will be nights to remember... "  
 ENG_tuc_economy:0 "Economic Policy"
 ENG_tuc_economy_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."
 ENG_tuc_internal:0 "Internal Policy"
 ENG_tuc_internal_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of internal policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The outcome is unsure, since it is here the real decision for the future of the Union will be made."
 ENG_tuc_military:0 "Military Affairs"
 ENG_tuc_military_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."
 ENG_tuc_foreign:0 "Foreign Policy"
 ENG_tuc_foreign_desc:0 "On this day of the TUC congress, the debate has wandered into the area of foreign policy. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions.

 ENG_central_industry_research:0 "Central Industry Research"

 ENG_local_help_desc:0 "Many Comrades in the Union of Britain are still living in great poverty. The bureaucracy has done little to help them. If we extended our support of the local councils, these suffering people would finally feel the blessings of the revolution."

 ENG_synthetic_industry:0 "Synthetic Industry"
 ENG_synthetic_industry_desc:0 "For the longest time, the British industry was dependent on imports from the colonies, and the economic impact of being cut off from these supplies is still very much felt.

 ENG_local_industry:0 "Local Industry Initiative"
 ENG_local_industry_desc:0 "The Syndicalist economy does not only consist of steel factories but also of small non-centralised manufactures. By supporting these independent Syndicates we will ensure versatile and flexible production."
 ENG_local_talent:0 "Local Talent Initiative"
 ENG_local_talent_desc:0 "We can not afford to waste innovative talent just because it is not centred in the metropolitan areas. We need to support local talent."

 ENG_local_initiative_desc:0 "It's local, and it's an Initiative giving Initiative to the locals. What's not to love?"
 ENG_political_commissars:0 "Political Commissars"
 ENG_political_commissars_desc:0 "Sometimes, even the most diligent Syndicalist needs a small reminder of his duties. Sometimes, that reminder should be given from behind a revolvers' sights."

 ENG_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "The Revolution must be defended from the attacks from Autonomists and Maximists! The only way forward is the orthodox one!"
 ENG_new_capital:0 "Move the TUC"
 ENG_new_capital_desc:0 "London is swamped in Centralism and so is the image of the TUC. Only by moving to a smaller city, easily reachable from all corners of the Union, will we able to guarantee a Union of all British nations. This city will be Birmingham."
 ENG_home_rule:0 "Home Rule"
 ENG_home_rule_desc:0 "Syndicalism has to be achieved locally. Some offices, like tax enforcers - nobody likes those people anyway - can be moved to the home nation capitals of Cardiff and Edinburgh. They can prepare the establishment of local TUCs."
 ENG_dissolve_tuc:0 "Dissolve the TUC"
 ENG_dissolve_tuc_desc:0 "The Trade Union Congress has served its part. By now, it has changed from a symbol of the Syndicalist dream to a symbol of Centralist repression.

 ENG_devolution:0 "Devolution"
 ENG_devolution_desc:0 "With the establishment of TUCs in Cardiff and Edinburgh, the process of Devolution will come to a successful end."
 ENG_turn_the_other_cheek:0 "Compromise with Maximists"
 ENG_turn_the_other_cheek_desc:0 "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We can not throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."
 ENG_city_upon_a_hill:0 "Compromise with Autonomists"
 ENG_city_upon_a_hill_desc:0 "Actually, it seems that being under attack from both flanks is kind of nasty. Our chance of realising at least some of our visions is now. We can not throw that chance away even if that may mean compromising with some more radical elements."
 ENG_evolution:0 "Evolution"
 ENG_evolution_desc:0 "Both the Autonomists and the Maximists are trying to change an already working machine. British Syndicalism is fine as it is; If only they would understand that..."
 ENG_merge:0 "The Grand Protector"
 ENG_merge_desc:0 "While it is unconstitutional, unifying the offices of General Secretary and Chairman of the Trade Union Congress in the new office of Grand Protector of the Union of Britain will give us much more power to push through our reforms."
 ENG_reform_militia:0 "Reform the Militias"
 ENG_reform_militia_desc:0 "The Worker's Militias have been reformed into something a little more usable while the old democratic structures have been preserved. They still somewhat hinder military efficiency - but that we are able to tolerate. Break the Chains!"
 ENG_dissolve_militias:0 "Dissolve the Militias"
 ENG_dissolve_militias_desc:0 "The arms in the hands of the rabble have been tolerated for too long now. While our enemies hold on to these remains of a bygone age for some reason we know that only discipline is the way forward."

 ENG_revolution:0 "Revolution"
 ENG_revolution_desc:0 "This whole 'reforming the country' business has turned out to be very boring. We can attempt one swift strike to totally seize the means of politics and make our political program a reality. This will be risky, though."
 ENG_central_command:0 "Central Command"
 ENG_central_command_desc:0 "We need to establish a central Army Headquarters to optimise communication and cooperation between army units. This will allow for more grand-scale operations to be planned in an efficient manner."
 ENG_improve_army:0 "A new Lee Enfield?"
 ENG_improve_army_desc:0 "The rifles supplied by the factories formerly owned by Lee Enfield still constitute the overwhelming majority of our infantry weapons. However, at least under gun connoisseurs, the weapons produced by the Birmingham Small Arms Factory have the reputation of being more suitable for offensive manoeuvres and change might be in order."
 ENG_improve_army2:0 "Improve the Army: The Lewis M1936"
 ENG_improve_army2_desc:0 "The equipment of the soldiers of the Revolution can never be perfect enough - time to improve upon our tried and tested design for a mainline machine gun!"

 ENG_copenhagen_conference:0 "Copenhagen Conference"
 ENG_copenhagen_conference_desc:0 "The uneasy peace between us and the exiled Royalists all around the world has lasted for too long. It is time to call a conference on neutral ground to determine a new status quo."

 ENG_military_interventions:0 "Military Interventions"

 ENG_class_war:0 "Class War"

 ENG_naval_dockyards:0 "Organised Dockyards"

 ENG_small_boat_research:0 "Escorts for RNS Rebecca"

 ENG_navy_doctrine:0 "Reform Whitehall"
 ENG_navy_doctrine_desc:0 "While the Admiralty of the Republican Navy still sits in Whitehall, where the British Navy had its headquarters for centuries, the brain drain following the revolution hasn't been completely overcome. And sadly...it's showing."
 ENG_big_boat_research:0 "Battle cruiser & Battleship Research"
 ENG_big_boat_research_desc:0 "The Republican Navy has put a lot of effort and resources into the RNS Rebecca - but its really not the right path. Battleships are simply so much cooler, but still, British Battleship design very much needs a few new ideas."

 ENG_anti_tank_research:0 "Anti-Tank & Anti-Air Research"

 ENG_air_doctrine:0 "Air Doctrine Research"
 ENG_air_doctrine_desc:0 "The ways in which air warfare has changed in this conflict have been astounding for all sides. Only by innovative adaption will we be able to hold the upper hand in the air."
 ENG_bomber_research:0 "Bomber Research"
 ENG_bomber_research_desc:0 "The enemy may focus on fighter research - but what good are improved interceptors if they only get to see our bombers over their burning factory halls?"
 ENG_motorized:0 "Motorised Research"
 ENG_motorized_desc:0 "While tanks are good and all somehow it seems they become even more useful when the infantry can actually keep up with them. Maybe we should investigate this circumstance."
 ENG_float_boat_research:0 "Carrier Research"
 ENG_float_boat_research_desc:0 "The Republican Navy has put a lot of effort and resources into the RNS Rebecca - Building on that accumulated expertise and further expanding our carrier fleet would be the next logical step."
 ENG_sub_research:0 "U-Boat Research Program"
 ENG_sub_research_desc:0 "According to the strategies employed by the German Kriegsmarine during the Weltkrieg, U-Boats are to be used as escorts for fleets of Main Battleships. This was proved successful during the later days of the war - we should continue accordingly."

 ENG_mission_to_norway:0 "Mission to Norway"
 ENG_mission_to_norway_desc:0 "Norway is rife for Syndicalism. We could send a team of politically experienced advisers and leaders to the Norwegian Syndicalist Party, bringing pressure on the capitalists and supporting the Syndicalists."
 ENG_invite_norway:0 "Invite Norway"
 ENG_invite_norway_desc:0 "Now that Norway is Syndicalist, we should offer to extend the friendship of the International to them."
 ENG_air1:0 "Controlling the Skies"
 ENG_air1_desc:0 "For thousands of years, Britains could rely on the Sea to keep them safe from any invaders. For the first time, we now have to confront the real possibility of an airborne invasion. But we can rely on a doctrine well-tested: Simply build as many as the next two together. More Fighters! More Bombers!"
 ENG_air21:0 "Controlling the Battlefield"
 ENG_air21_desc:0 "While the battle in the air is important, we still need boots on the ground to win the war. We should set our industrial capacities accordingly."
 ENG_air22:0 "R.A.D.A.R."
 ENG_air22_desc:0 "A new technology by the name of R.A.D.A.R. could help us avoid suffering what we want to inflict on our enemies."
 ENG_tuc2:0 "Another Congress of the Trade Unions"

 ENG_tuc2_economy:0 "The State of the Economy"
 ENG_tuc2_economy_desc:0 "Our economy was enlarged in the time leading up to the war. The extraordinary congress now has to face the decision of either pushing for further expansion or prioritising the healing of the wounds inflicted by the war."
 ENG_tuc2_demobilization:0 "Demobilisation Program"
 ENG_tuc2_demobilization_desc:0 "Fighting the war was hard; Living peace will be even harder. A program to ensure a regulated turn to peace production is in order."
 ENG_tuc2_internal:0 "Cut out Red Tape"
 ENG_tuc2_internal_desc:0 "Fighting a war often allows for some more unsavoury elements of the bureaucracy to carve out their own little empires while the government is embroiled in defending the homeland. We need to overcome these war profiteers with all due haste."

 uob.1.t:0 "Vote for economic policy"
 uob.1.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of economics. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. Most people assume that the Maximists will win this debate, since Oswald Mosley is a major figure in the British economy these days."

 uob.1.b:0 "Fed.: The economy must be expanded and centralised"
 uob.1.c:0 "Aut.: Greater economic autonomy must be given to the Home Nations"
 uob.2.t:0 "Vote for internal policy"

 uob.2.a:0 "Max.: The local governments must be brought in line with the TUC"
 uob.2.b:0 "Fed.: The current system is satisfactory"
 uob.2.c:0 "Aut.: Decentralisation - perhaps even local TUC's for the Home Nations"
 uob.3.t:0 "Defecting Officers"
 uob.3.d:0 "In light of the recent demonstration of political freedom on our Island some Royalist officers have defected to us - namely Adm. Willis, Gen. Hutton and Weltkrieg Hero Gen. Alexander. They could help the Republican Army and Navy with their expertise. However, while we don't have any proof there is suspicion that some of them may have fought against the Workers in the Second Glorious Revolution."
 uob.3.a:0 "The Congress will decide on their fate"
 uob.4.t:0 "Vote for military policy"
 uob.4.d:0 "The debate has wandered into the area of military affairs. As has been predicted, every faction has put forward their own suggestions. The debate is heated, since the last few days have only too clearly shown the deep rift within the TUC."

 uob.6.t:0 "The Resignation of Philip Snowden"
 uob.6.d:0 "On the last day of the TUC congress Chairman Philip Snowden climbed up to the podium and made a speech. He claimed that in face of massive rifts within the TUC and due to his age he intends to resign his post. He also pulled out the cliche 'time with the family' bit that all politicans do. The congregation stood silent as he climbed down from the podium and made his way out of the hall. The country is shocked and in a few days' time the TUC will have to vote on a new chairman."
 uob.6.a:0 "Shocking, to say the least"
 uob.7.t:0 "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure a Majority"
 uob.7.d:0 "The TUC has decided to vote for Oswald Mosley's Maximists with an overwhelming majority. Oswald Mosley will become the new Chairman of the TUC."

 uob.10.t:0 "Chairman Election - Maximists Secure no Majority"

 uob.11.t:0 "Chairman Election - Autonomists Secure no Majority"
 uob.11.d:0 "The TUC has decided to vote for Niclas y Glais' Autonomists - but not with any great majority. Niclas y Glais will become the new Chairman of the TUC but he will have to compromise with other factions."

 uob.14.ac:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Kenney"
 uob.14.ad:0 "Congratulations, Comrade Horner"
 uob.15.t:0 "Show of Force"
 uob.15.d:0 "With the newest aircraft carrier RNS Rebecca fully operational the Republican Navy was ready to reclaim her rightful position among the mightiest navies of the world. However the target of her first action was heavily disputed. Most officers opted for a full scale naval manoeuvre near Ireland or even further west wards - near the Azores or Iceland. But a naval manoeuvre of such large scale would surely draw attention of the much more powerful and heavily armed Hochseeflotte and even the smaller Canadian Royal navy might be forced to organize countermeasures. Most members of the Congress of Trade Unions opted for a small scale manoeuvre possibly without even leaving British territorial waters. Ultimately the Naval Commissar was inclined in favour for the Irish option."
 uob.15.a:0 "Keep the fleet in our territorial waters"
 uob.15.b:0 "Send the Grand Fleet towards Ireland"
 uob.15.c:0 "Divide the fleet and perform manoeuvres near the Azores and Iceland"
 uob.16.t:0 "British Fleet Manoeuvres"
 uob.16.d:0 "The British navy has steamed out of its ports and has assembled to demonstrate its power against our neutral island. In face of this grave situation many politicians suggest that Ireland should find someone to guarantee its independence. The most reasonable option would be Germany - but there are even some advocating a return to Windsor protection."
 uob.16.a:0 "Maintain our neutrality"
 uob.16.b:0 "Ask the Kaiser for protection"
 uob.16.c:0 "Ask the Canadian king for protection"
 uob.17.t:0 "Ireland asks for help"
 uob.17.d:0 "The Irish have asked for our support in face of Socialist violations of their neutrality. This gives us an opportunity to recover a part of our sphere of influence and undermine the socialist activities in the region."
 uob.17.a:0 "Proclaim that Ireland is protected by the Entente"
 uob.17.b:0 "Announce our support for Ireland"
 uob.17.c:0 "We are not ready for such involvement in the Old World"
 uob.18.t:0 "Canada protects Ireland"
 uob.18.d:0 "The Canadian government has proposed to offer the Irish military and diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. Even though there are still many circles fearing the potential rise of Windsor influence this is clearly a step towards Irish security."
 uob.18.a:0 "Most splendid!"
 uob.18.b:0 "Bloody hell!"
 uob.19.t:0 "Canada supports Ireland"
 uob.19.d:0 "The Canadian government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Canadians are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict. Still, Britain is widely expected to ease their policy towards Ireland until the diplomatic climate changes."
 uob.19.a:0 "At least we're not alone..."
 uob.19.b:0 "It may actually be quite wise to do so..."
 uob.20.t:0 "Canada abandons Ireland"
 uob.20.d:0 "The Canadian government has ignored the Irish call for help. Whatever comes next they must be prepared for the worst as this gives the British a free hand in choosing their next step towards the Emerald Isle."
 uob.20.a:0 "Oh no!"
 uob.20.b:0 "Rule Britannia!"

 uob.23.t:0 "Germany supports Ireland"
 uob.23.d:0 "The German government has offered full diplomatic support against the Union of Britain. While it is an important political gesture it has little true value as the Germans are rather unlikely to directly intervene in any potential conflict. Still, Britain is widely expected to ease their policy towards Ireland until the diplomatic climate changes."

This is not a direct threat towards the Entente but many officials believe that leaving it unattended is not a wise choice.

His time as an agitator is over, but his time as a Syndicalist hero has only just begun."

 uob.157.d:0 "The Syndicalist experiment in Britain is over! The military, commanded by the war hero T.E. Lawrence, also known as 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Lawrence of Germania' has taken control. The background of the coup is unclear; It seems that infighting between the wings of the Syndicalist government is involved. Lawrence has called for an immediate cease-fire at all fronts, he wants to bring the British troops back home and begin the process of reinstating the monarchy."

 uob.158.t:0 "What now?"
 uob.158.d:0 "Interim Chairman Lawrence has never been comfortable ruling a socialist nation such as ours. A good man and loyal Briton at heart, he was more at home agitating foreign peoples than overseeing five-year plans. Comrade Wintringham approached him and asked if he will allow a Congress to meet as soon as possible and establish a new civilian government - or maybe he has other ideas..."

It has been agreed that Maximism, Sorelianism and National-Syndicalism all share basic principles of the state's primacy in the socialist struggle, the role of national identity within the state and the importance of a strong central authority to preserve and build socialism. The charter also claims the socialist state is the final stage of human development and that democracy is not necessary to achieve socialism. These statements have drawn great criticisms from other socialist factions, who gave it the name "Totalism" as a play on totalitarian socialism, which has been eagerly accepted by Mosely who added it to the manifesto's name, attributing it to their total commitment to socialism. All present  politicians and philosophers have signed the manifesto entitled 'The Totalist Charter', available in all appropriate languages."

They argue that 'all arts need to be brought together to create an actual, total work of art, a Gesamtkunstwerk.' Needless to say, many of the proposers have adapted this view of the arts onto their political life, where they stand for Maximist views. They have also made themselves quite popular with drafts for Unionized Living Space for poorer comrades. \n\nThe artistic world of the Union is divided as sculptors, potters and writers deny having to do anything with those architects, and a clear path must be set.

During the Weltkrieg, it was transformed into the Royal Navy training station HMS Victory VI. As a result, it became one of the last holdouts of royalists in London, and was destroyed by fire during the Revolution. The gutted skeleton of the building has been left to rot over the last ten years as London worked on its industry and defences. A proposal has been put forward to rebuild the Crystal Palace as an exhibition hall where the men and women of the International will display their industrial and cultural products as equals, not as imperial trophies. However, it would be an expensive undertaking to get it ready in time for next year, and a large part of the Congress advocates simply tearing the ruins down and expanding the surrounding parkland."

 # Minister Bios
 ENG_horner_desc:0 "Arthur Horner was born in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, the eldest surviving son of a family of seventeen children only six of whom lived past infancy. Horner's father was a chargehand porter in the railway goods station. His maternal grandfather and two maternal uncles were miners. His earliest employment was as a grocer’s assistant and delivery boy in the coalfield communities around Merthyr. After a short spell in Merthyr railway goods station he was drawn into coal mining employment in 1915 due to his growing interest in the political radicalism of trade union activists in the nearby Rhondda coalfield. \n Horner's first political affiliation was socialist and Keir Hardie, who had been elected MP for Merthyr Tydfil in 1900, his first political hero. After he had joined the Independent Labour Party in Merthyr, Horner moved to the colliery village of Ynyshir in the Rhondda where he became a protégé of Noah Ablett, trade union militant, executive member of the South Wales Miners Federation and also convenor of local classes in Marxist education which Horner attended. During this period Horner gradually relinquished the strong Christian faith of his teenage years during which he had been baptised into the Churches of Christ. This small but intellectually inclined Protestant sect, had recognised his potential talent as a preacher and financed a period of training for him as a lay evangelist from which he gained considerable confidence in public speaking and debate. \n Opposing the Weltkrieg from the standpoint of class solidarity, in 1917 he fled to Dublin to avoid arrest for ignoring his call-up papers. Horner was a supporter of demands for Irish home-rule and became involved with the rebel factions from the 1916 Easter Rising, joining the Irish Citizen Army. On his return to Britain he was arrested by the authorities for avoiding conscription and sentenced to six months hard labour at Wormwood Scrubs. After he had served his sentence he was refused the amnesty made available after the war to most conscientious objectors, rearrested and sent to Camarthen jail. The SWMF campaigned for his release and to this end secured his election in absentia as checkweighman at Mardy Colliery, one of the most militant collieries in the Rhondda valleys. To add to the pressure on the authorities Horner began a hunger strike, refusing both food and water. After six days this combination of tactics secured his release in May 1919. Horner then went on to play an active role in the 1925 British Revolution."

 # Tech
 ####Submarines#####
 ENG_submarine_1:0 "L Class"
 ENG_submarine_1_desc:0 "The L-class were medium sized boats originally planned under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding program of 1938-1943 as an improved version of the previous submarine classes. They were built in the late stages of the first Weltkrieg and were equipped with new, larger 21 in. torpedoes. They were used even after the modernization project of the 1930s and 1940s."
 ENG_submarine_2:0 "T Class"
 ENG_submarine_2_desc:0 "The To-class or Triton-class boats were designed to replace the O, P, and R class large submarines. They were moderately large submarines with long range well-suited for the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. These boats were well-armed, stable platforms and were used extensively during the conflicts throughout this time period."
 ENG_submarine_3:0 "U Class"
 ENG_submarine_3_desc:0 "The U class were small-sized submarines built under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943. Originally designed as training submarines as the war broke out, the design changed, allowing these submarines to prove useful in the confined waters of the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Due to their smaller size, their range and the weaponry were limited. Three subclasses made up the class: Undine, Umpire and Uproar."
 ENG_submarine_4:0 "V Class"
 ENG_submarine_4_desc:0 "The V-class or Vampire-class submarines were based on the previous U-class smaller sized boats. They were larger but still relatively small, with better seagoing ability but limited operational range and weaponry."
 ####Destroyers#####
 ENG_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
 ENG_destroyer_1_desc:0 "These destroyers included the Admiralty and Thornycroft V and W classes. They were built under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943. They were the ultimate evolution of British destroyer design during the First Weltkrieg, embodying the improvements of their predecessors as well as new technological advances. Large numbers of these ships were built during the late stages of WK1 and became the backbone of the Republican Navy's destroyer flotillas after the 1925 revolution. Beginning in the 1930s, they were placed into reserve fleets, used eventually relegated to convoy escort duties. They were adequately-armed, fast vessels with good range."
 ENG_destroyer_2:0 "G/H/I Class"
 ENG_destroyer_2_desc:0 "The G, H, and I class destroyers were ordered as part of the 1933 and 1934 Naval Construction Programs. They were generally repeats of the preceding F class, with a slight reduction in size. Armament in the G and H classes is the same as in the F class, with both using the 4.7 in. guns. These ships had long range, were adequately armed, and had a strong torpedo complement. They were used extensively during the war and suffered numerous losses."
 ENG_destroyer_3:0 "J/K/N Class"
 ENG_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The J, K, and N classes were similar to the earlier Tribal class but rather than emphasizing gun armament, the designers returned to a more standard heavy torpedo and lighter gun setup. The ships were modified throughout their wartime service. Upgrades included improved anti-aircraft guns and radar. They were fast, long-ranged and well-armed vessels ideal for fleet escorts."
 ENG_destroyer_4:0 "Sark Class"
 ENG_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Sark-class destroyers built upon the evolution of British destroyers used throughout the war. The ships were ordered as part of the 1942 and 1943 Naval Programs. They were well-armed in terms of both their guns and their torpedoes. Their AA armament ASW capabilities, speed, and range made them versatile vessels."
 ###Light Cruisers####
 ENG_light_cruiser_1:0 "C Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_1_desc:1 "C-class light cruisers were a group of light cruisers built before and during the First Weltkrieg for the rough conditions of the North Sea. They proved to be rugged and capable vessels despite being somewhat small and cramped. Their armament was more than satisfactory, as they carried enough 6 in. guns to fight enemy surface targets and a heavy torpedo load to finish off enemy vessels and convoys. They saw extensive use during WWI and participated in many surface actions."
 ENG_light_cruiser_2:0 "York Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The York-class light cruisers were a subclass of the Town-class cruisers and were designed to counter the German Emden-class cruisers. These vessels were well-armored, had good speed and range, and carried a formidable armament of twelve 6 in. guns in four triple turrets. They were the basis for many of the subsequent RN wartime light cruiser designs."
 ENG_light_cruiser_3:0 "Birmingham Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Birmingham-class light cruisers were improved versions of the earlier Town class but with a simplified design to speed up construction and reduce costs. The ships carried the same guns as their predecessors, four triple turrets housing 6 in. guns. They were similarly armored but because of their smaller engines, their range is somewhat reduced."
 ENG_light_cruiser_4:0 "London Class"
 ENG_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Also known as the Swiftsure class, these cruisers were designed as a modified version of the Birmingham class, incorporating war modifications that were authorized in 1941. They had a longer operational range and more numerous AA weaponry than the Birmingham class, while the main armament was reduced to three triple turrets. "
 ###Heavy Cruisers####
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Hawkins Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Hawkins-class cruisers were the first heavy cruisers in the world. They were based on the earlier Town-class light cruisers, particularly the Birmingham subclass, but equipped with 7.5 in. guns and a thicker armor belt. They were designed to fight the large convoy raiders of Germany. They were well-armed, had reasonable speed and range, and good protection."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Essex Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Essex-class heavy cruisers were the first class of Heavy Cruisers built by the Union of Britain followed the revolution in 1925. They were improved versions of the earlier York-class heavy cruisers. Had they been completed, they had been equipped with four twin 8 in. gun turrets, heavier armor, and more powerful engines."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Cumberland Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The Cumberland-class heavy cruisers were an attempt by the Republican Navy to design and build cruisers armed with 8 in. guns. Design studies started in 1938 and ended in 1941, resulting in various proposals. The final proposals featured new 8 in. guns in triple turrets, a heavy AA armament, thick armor, and good speed. A lack of enemy cruisers and the cost efficiency of these vessels resulted in a focus on building more light cruisers instead."
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Somerset Class"
 ENG_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Somerset Class was designed during the 1940s to counter the German Deutschland class big gun cruisers. These vessels had 9.2 in. cannons, heavy AA, and strong armor. They were designed to effectively battle the enemy capital ships."
 ###Battle Cruiser####
 ENG_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Revolution Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Revolution-Class, also called the Renown Class, were originally laid down as improved versions of the Revenge-class battleships. Their construction was suspended at the outbreak of WKI. Following the revolution, the new Republican Navy managed to restart their construction as battle cruisers. These ships were the quintessential battle cruiser. They were well-armed, fast, and maneuverable, but had thinner armor and a shorter operational range."
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Invincible Class"
 ENG_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Invincible were a class of battle cruisers that were a faster and cheaper version of the Blake-class battleships. These vessels carried a similar but reduced armament for both surface and anti-air combat: two triple 14 in. cannons and six twin 5.25 in. AA guns. Their fast speed and long range would provide the Republican Navy quick strike capabilities and convoy protection, but their limited armor would prove problematic if they had to fight modern battleships."
 ###Battleships#### 
 ENG_battleship_1:1 "Revenge Class"
 ENG_battleship_1_desc:1 "The Revenge-class battleships were ordered in 1913 as cheap versions of the Queen Elizabeth-class fast dreadnoughts. While similarly armed and armored, their considerably lower speed relegated them to secondary duties during WWII. Of the envisioned 8 ships of the class, only 5 were finished."
 ENG_battleship_2:0 "Blake Class"
 ENG_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Blake-class battleships were the first Battleships that the Republican Navy designed. As such, these ships were equipped with smaller-caliber cannons than earlier and even contemporary battleships. Despite the smaller caliber, the ships were adequately armed, carried strong AA weaponry, and had adequate protection. They were designed to replace the old Queen Elizabeth Class battleships that were used by the old regime."
 ENG_battleship_3:0 "Lilburne Class"
 ENG_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Lilburne-class battleships were the follow-up class to the Blake battleships, incorporating many of their features. The vessels are similar to the Black-Class ships, but the main armament would be heavier, introducing a new 16 in. cannon. They would also have had thicker armor and more powerful engines."
 ENG_battleship_4:0 "Fairfax Class"
 ENG_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Fairfax-class battleship was the last battleship to be built for the Republican Navy. Ordered under the Republican Admiralty shipbuilding programs of 1938-1943, construction did not gain a high priority and was finished after the war. The class had a sleek hull, giving excellent stability and seaworthiness. The armament is the same as the Revenge class battleships, providing considerable firepower. Strong engines and good armor made the vessel fast and well protected."
 ###Super Heavy Battleships###
 ENG_SH_battleship_1:0 "Winstanley Class"
 ENG_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Winstanley is a class of heavy battleships of the Republican Navy built to counter the large vessels of the German navy. Large 18 in. guns and thick armor provide the ship with the necessary firepower and protection to battle these vessels. Strong AA armament, long range, and good speed were a necessity to cover the seas around the Union of Britain."
 ENG_SH_battleship_2:0 "Sexby Class"
 ENG_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Sexby-Class battleships were designed in 1944 as an improved version of the earlier Lion-class battleship. Incorporating wartime lessons, this design was larger and heavier, and if completed, would carry either three or four triple 16 in. guns of the latest type. Thick armor plates protected the ship from any surface or aerial foe. The cost to build these ships, the defeat of enemy navies, and the need for aircraft carriers resulted in the abandonment of the project."
 ####Carriers###
 ENG_carrier_1:0 "Owen Class"
 ENG_carrier_1_desc:0 "These three aircraft carriers were converted battle cruisers and were the first fleet carriers of the Republican Navy. Their conversions came about following the revolution in 1925. They were moderately-armored but well-armed vessels, with long range and good speed, but due to the nature of the conversion their aircraft complement is limited. Nonetheless, they gave the Republican Navy important experience in aircraft carrier construction and fleet air projection."
 ENG_carrier_2:0 "Besant Class" 
 ENG_carrier_2_desc:0 "The Besant aircraft carrier was the first proper aircraft carrier to be built by the Republican Navy. She is the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull. Designed in 1934, the vessel is well-armored and armed. It carried a large complement of aircraft and had adequate operational range and speed to keep up with the forces of the Republican Navy."
 ENG_carrier_3:0 "Wallas Class"
 ENG_carrier_3_desc:0 "The Wallas class was designed to be an armored aircraft carrier. Due to the armoring on the ship it limited the size to an upper limit of 23,000 tons. She was the first British carrier to have an armored flight deck, which reduced its air group size. Heavy armor and AA weaponry provided a strong defense for the ships, while powerful engines and a large fuel store gave the ships long operational range."
 ENG_carrier_4:0 "Morris Class"
 ENG_carrier_4_desc:0 "The Morris-class aircraft carriers were ordered under the 1938 Naval Program and were essentially improved versions of the earlier Wallas class. The war and the shift of priority to smaller vessels for convoy protection duties in the early and middle stages of the war slowed the constriction of these vessels. They were larger vessels able to carry more planes while maintaining thick armor on both the hull and flight deck. More powerful engines gave it greater speed and operational range compared to the Wallas class."
