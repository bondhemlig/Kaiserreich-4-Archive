IRE_ARD:0 "Agricultural Reform Drive"
IRE_ARD_desc:0 "The rural areas of Ireland are by far the most neglected by the government to date, and could easily serve as a starting point for radical economic improvement. Our farming methods are woefully out of date compared to the agricultural revolutions taking place in mainland Europe, and our infrastructure is woefully behind."

ire.59.t:0 "The Agricultural Reform Drive"
ire.59.d:0 "We have left our rural areas in a state of backwards insignificance for far too long. It is time that we do something. Ireland is moving forward, and so too must her rural communities. Much of our industry has traditionally relied upon agriculture, but times have changed. If we want to keep agriculture as a vital part of our economy, then we need to upgrade our farming facilities. Similarly, much of Ireland's road systems are in a state of complete disrepair, and currently the responsibility for repair work of any kind falls to private enterprise. Our transport network in general could be considerably improved, allowing us to move both people and economic goods around the country at a more rapid rate. This situation calls for obvious economic expenditure, but we must keep the national debt in mind. More radical changes will encourage the population that we are serious about dealing with the issue, however."
ire.59.a:0 "Let's not push it too much."

IRE_MFR:0 "Mechanised Farming Reform"
IRE_MFR_desc:0 "There's no doubt that the farming industry is one of the biggest in our nation. The current agricultural techniques used however leave a lot to be desired. Through adopting the sort of advances in mechanisation seen in the United States and in Europe, we can bring our farms up to speed. Farms feed the people, and therefore they are the lifeblood of growth."
ire.60.t:0 "Mechanised Farming Investment"
ire.60.d:0 "Because of our expansive investment policy, we have seen fit to implement more further reaching farming reforms than would otherwise have been possible. Mechanising our farms will finally help Ireland overcome the shadow of the Great Famine, and will help our population to grow."

Ireland has a long and proud tradition of producing Irish whisky, but much of the production is done in small family-run distilleries throughout the countryside. The proposed Saorstát development will open up several alcohol factories and produce some much-needed employment for our nation, but the location for the development has yet to be decided, only that it should be in one of our less industrially developed regions."

IRE_RTN:0 "Revitalise the North"
IRE_RTN_desc:0 "After the 1925 ceasefire, the northern most region of Ulster has been in an industrial slump relative to the rest of the nation. Belfast once used to be a thriving industrial city and other towns and cities such as Derry and Coleraine were looking likely to follow. Revisiting this issue and energising the north with industrial investments will help to lift the region."
ire.67.t:0 "The Harland & Wolff Shipyard"
ire.67.d:0 "During the early 1900s, the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast had the prestigious honour of being the world's largest shipyard. After the capitulation of the British Empire during the first Weltkrieg and their second capitulation not long after to the Trade Unionists, it has fallen into disrepair and has been overtaken by other yards throughout the world. With refurbishment, it could once again be a great asset, but this time for Ireland, not the British Imperialists."
ire.67.a:0 "With some repairs and a recruiting effort, the shipyard will create a good few jobs."
ire.67.b:0 "Harland & Wolff will shine once again."

ire.68.t:0 "The Short Brothers Company"
ire.68.d:0 "Founded in England in 1908, the Short Brothers PLC is a private aerospace company with some existing operations in Northern Ireland. Having seen their business suffer significant losses thanks to the fate of the British Empire, they are now looking for new opportunities and see expansion in Ulster as their highest priority. We can subsidise their venture at some cost to our nation, but the benefits of having a prominent aerospace industry are obvious in peace and wartime." 
ire.68.a:0 "Help them settle."
ire.68.b:0 "Make a significant investment."
ire.68.c:0 "Belfast shall become their worldwide headquarters. Throw money at them."

Recent economic developments in the nation have been seen as an encouraging sign that the Dáil is committed to completing Ireland's economic rebirth.

ire.92.t:0 "A Small Step for Ireland..."
ire.92.d:0 "The Éireann Scientific Innovation Council (ESIC) is a newly created sub-department of the government, with one simple purpose in mind: a devotion to academia and scientific progress. Ireland has long been seen as a rural backwater by other world powers, a place that progress seemed to leave behind. Whilst a cruel opinion, it is not without truth. Centuries of British rule left Ireland largely neglected whilst the rest of the world raced on. It's time to catch up. The ESIC will be composed of expert scientists recruited from both the Irish population and from friendly foreign allies. ESIC research teams will increase our overall research efficiency and may even occasionally produce major breakthroughs in certain fields. The government must now decide how important the ESIC is to the nation: how much funds should they receive?"

IRE_IRF:0 "Industrial Research Priorities"
IRE_IRF_desc:0 "Our national has a vital need for industry, and that need is coupled with an equal requirement for research and development. Many of our factories are decrepit and out of date. To build a modern industry, Ireland needs modern factories. Investing into industrial research will allow us to move further towards progress."
IRE_ISP:0 "Irish Synthetics Project"
IRE_ISP_desc:0 "Although our people are industrious and our island ripe for industrialisation, there is no accounting for the unfortunate lack of natural resources available to us relative to the major powers of the world.

IRE_XPESIC:0 "Expand the ESIC"
IRE_XPESIC_desc:0 "The ESIC have been doing a fantastic job to date, but they still have room to grow.

The state of our economy to date has been rather unimpressive and uninviting, but with the recent developments spurred on by the IEAA, perhaps we can begin improving this situation.

ire.96.t:0 "The Dáil Decides: Immigration"
ire.96.d:0 "As part of their new IEAA initiative, the Dáil have argued for the expansion of Ireland's immigration policies. Under British rule, immigration to Ireland was almost non-existent and actively discouraged. Now that Ireland is free and her economy is growing at a rapid rate, there is an opportunity to start actively encouraging immigration. This process could prove extremely costly however, as significant funds will have to be invested in housing developments and administrative processes. There may also be social unrest with a large influx of immigrants arriving on Irish shores. Our choice of policy going forward will be very important for our nation, and it's important to consider the potential consequences."

IRE_MILITARYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Whilst the people of Ireland would prefer peace to war, there is no doubt that war may very well be on the horizon.

IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY:0 "Heavy Industrial Focus"
IRE_HEAVYINDUSTRY_desc:0 "Ireland is a small nation and can only spare so much space for a military arms complex. The military factories that we do build need to be built specialised for war, able to run efficient production lines and generate a high degree of output. We cannot waste our time with converting civilian factories into war-machines."

IRE_NORMALINDUSTRY_desc:0 "To adapt to the ever-changing environment, it is vital that the Irish arms industry stays flexible. We might expect to be at war eventually, but that war will not last forever.

ire.1.d:0 "Éire finds herself once again in a grave crisis. Our strategic planners foresaw that this day would come, and now that we are at war, it is time to make good use of their foresight. Brave sons of Ireland await the command across the nation to take up arms and defend their country from foreign aggressors." 
ire.1.a:0 "We need them all."
ire.1.b:0 "A half company will do."
ire.1.c:0 "Call up only the infantry reserves."

# Introduction Events
ire.2.t:0 "The State of the Republic, 1936"
ire.2.d:0 "After countless years of arduous rebellion and weathering oppressive British rule, the Irish people have won their freedom, and their country back. But as one enemy was vanquished, another rose in her place, perhaps yet more dangerous still. Michael Collins sits a reluctant dictator, eager to defend the independence of his nation at any cost, yet his political enemies are many. Ireland is a powder keg, and it's only a matter of time until it explodes." 
ire.2.a:0 "These are turbulent times."

ire.53.t:0 "Problems Up North"
ire.53.d:0 "Just as the history of Ireland herself is one filled with conflict and hardship, so too is that of her northernmost region of Ulster. Home to a Protestant Irish majority, perceived by much of the Republic as British in all but name, Ulster has long been the home of Unionist sentiment. The Unionists by far lost the most when Ireland gained her freedom, and it was only thanks to an agreement between Collins and the Unionist leader James Craig in 1925 that Ireland has not seen a prolonged civil war. In the years that have past, Ulster has grown increasingly isolated from the rest of Ireland both economically and culturally, as attempts to integrate the region fully have failed. Some believe that the Unionists are merely biding their time, waiting to rise up once again..." 
ire.53.a:0 "We'll be ready for them if they do."

ire.54.t:0 "An Impoverished Nation"
ire.54.d:0 "In the years since Ireland achieved her independence, the economy has grown, but much more slowly than many would have liked. The average Irish citizen in 1936 finds themselves impoverished, with unemployment rampant. The economic strength of the Emerald Isle pales completely in comparison to the enemy lurking across the Irish Sea, the Union of Britain. The need for economic growth is pressing, with the citizenry looking towards Collins and the Dáil to get the nation back on its feet. Although a small nation, Ireland's population are hardworking and there is plenty of room for economic growth. But it will not come at an easy cost." 
ire.54.a:0 "We'll see what we can do." 

# Unionist Tensions (and debug)

ire.4.t:0 "Ulster at Peace"
ire.4.d:0 "After the recent unrest, the people of Ulster seem to once again be at peace. There's no telling for how long this peace will last, but there's no doubt that Ireland is better off for it. The Dáil has one less issue to deal with."
ire.4.a:0 "What a relief."
ire.5.t:0 "Disgruntled Populace in Ulster"
ire.5.d:0 "For some time now, there has been a slow but surely growing unrest in the northern region of Ireland, Ulster. Stirred up by predominantly Protestant Unionists, who advocate for closer ties with England, Ulster has become something of a problem region for the Dáil. If this situation is not handled carefully, the issues that divide the region are sure to grow more incendiary."
ire.5.a:0 "This is a delicate matter."
ire.6.t:0 "Radical Movements Mobilising"
ire.6.d:0 "In response to what they see as oppressive policies towards the people of Ulster, Unionist organisations are growing more radical and attracting the most disenfranchised and angry Northerners to their cause. They are presently meeting in secret in pubs and Orange Order halls around the country, safe from the prying eyes of the Gardaí."
ire.6.a:0 "Bloody radicals."
ire.7.t:0 "Riots in Belfast"
ire.7.d:0 "The streets of Belfast are in an uproar after the Unionists have begun to make their play for a general uprising. Disgruntled Ulstermen, the vast majority of which are Protestants, have taken to the streets in a violent stand against what they believe to be hostile intentions from Dublin. The Dáil has called an emergency meeting to address their grievances, but that may not be enough to stop them."
ire.7.a:0 "Madness."
ire.8.t:0 "Civil War Imminent"
ire.8.d:0 "All measures, peaceful or otherwise, to try and pacify Ulster has failed. The Ulster Unionists, backed by the Ulster Volunteer Force, have announced their independence from Ireland and have declared that they will defend the province of Ulster to the death from Dublin, and Catholic, rule. A civil war is inevitable."
ire.8.a:0 "God help us."

ire.131.t:0 "Radical Movements Diminishing"
ire.131.d:0 "The more radical elements of the Ulster region are slowly but surely diminishing. While the core members will remain as extreme as ever, they are finding it harder to recruit new members thanks to our latest policy changes. If things turn for the worse though, they'll most likely find followers soon enough, and we have to be wary. There's no peace in Ulster yet, only silence."
ire.131.a:0 "We'd best stay on our guard."

ire.132.t:0 "Riots Dispersed"
ire.132.d:0 "The streets of Belfast have been silenced and there are no riots anymore. Bricks, newspapers and trash litter the sideways as people return to work. However, the people who participated believe they have only lost a battle, not the war. In their work-place, at the pub and at home they whisper of when to strike next, not if."
ire.132.a:0 "At least they aren't in the streets."

# Debt Warning Events - Level 0
ire.17.t:0 "The National Debt"
ire.17.d:0 "After the recent passage of the IEAA, the Dáil has held several meetings with financial experts from the Bank of Ireland in order to ascertain the current economic status of the nation. Although there is room for rapid economic growth, it will almost certainly come at the cost of raking up a significant national debt. Ireland's treasury is currently understocked after such a long period of British exploitation, and the only way that treasury will grow is through economic reform. The Bank of Ireland suggest a steady and careful approach to expansion, but it is ultimately up to the nation’s leaders to decide."
ire.17.a:0 "We should monitor this situation closely."

# Level 1

ire.18.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.18.d:0 "Following recent investments by the Irish government into economic and industrial reforms, the national debt has grown slightly. This is presently nothing to worry about, and the Dáil stresses that this investment is necessary for Ireland to have a bright future."
ire.18.a:0 "Well, you need to break a few eggs to make an omelette."

# Level 2

ire.19.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.19.d:0 "Continued investiture by the Irish government into the economic sector has led to a slow growth of the national debt. The situation is still entirely under control, although conservatives among the public are growing slightly concerned at what they feel may be excess spending."
ire.19.a:0 "They call them conservative for a reason."

# Level 3

ire.20.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.20.d:0 "Amidst considerable spending by the Dáil in an effort to improve the nation’s economy, the national debt has risen considerably in recent times and is now reaching a point where top financial experts in Ireland are forecasting growing problem areas in the economy. This has led to a downfall in public support for the government."
ire.20.a:0 "This was never going to be an easy time."

# Level 4

ire.21.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.21.d:0 "There were protests outside the Dáil this morning in response to what is seen as increasingly reckless and haphazard spending by the government. Whilst it's true that Ireland's economy may be better off in the long-term, the short-term effects of the growing national debt are starting to rear their ugly head."
ire.21.a:0 "This is starting to turn ugly."

# Level 5

ire.22.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.22.d:0 "Dangerous and Irresponsible. The damning headline of the Irish Independent this morning leads into an article that strongly criticises the government for their continued economic spending. Public interest groups are mobilising and there are fears that Ireland is heading for an economic bubble that could have devastating effects on her economy."
ire.22.a:0 "Time for a change in policy..?"

# Level 6

ire.23.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.23.d:0 "Businesses are starting to shut up shop and foreign investors are quickly beginning to consider transferring or liquidating their assets in Ireland. The stock market in Dublin is said to be heading for a complete crash, and whispers from the Dáil talk about a black hole in the budget. Ireland is on the brink of financial ruin."
ire.23.a:0 "Heads will roll for this."

# Level 7

ire.25.t:0 "The National Debt Increases"
ire.25.d:0 "There were riots in the streets today as the Dáil was forced to admit that they may have seriously underestimated the amount of money required to fund their economic investments. As a result, the financial capitulation of Ireland is all but a certainty. The businessmen of Dublin can do little more than sit around, transfixed by the horror of the economic turmoil that is surely soon to come."
ire.25.a:0 "Is it too late for Ireland?"

# Level 8

ire.24.t:0 "The Irish Market Collapses"
ire.24.d:0 "The Dáil is an uproar this morning after the head of government was forced to announce that, regrettably, the national debt has grown so immensely large that the state is now officially considered bankrupt by foreign bodies. The Irish market subsequently crashed in less than an hour and people are taking to the streets in droves, prompting the IRA to be deployed to the capital to restore order. Something radical is needed to save the economy!"

Brugha had been on a good-will tour, hoping to cultivate votes in the troubled region of Ulster. Rumours are already beginning to circulate that the assassination was orchestrated by Unionist dissidents, although no known groups have presently claimed responsibility. The de facto leadership of the party now falls to Margaret Buckley, a native of Cork. The party is bound to find themselves in disarray after this shocking and tragic turn of events."

# Unionist Protest March
ire.36.t:0 "Unionists Organise Protest March"
ire.36.d:0 "News has spread from Belfast this morning that the Unionists are organising a protest march against what they perceive to be unfair treatment from the government in Dublin. Since Ireland gained her independence, the people of Ulster have become increasingly marginalised and attempts to 'green' up the region and purge the British legacy there have thus far failed. The idea of letting this march go undeterred does not sit well with the majority of the Irish people, or the government. But stopping it may only make the situation worse..."

Her body had obviously been taken some distance from the site of the murder itself. A letter claiming responsibility arrived at the Gardaí headquarters in Belfast, sent allegedly by the Ulster Volunteer Force. The murder appears to have been an act of retaliation for the government’s recent decision to ban an attempted Unionist Protest March. News of the murder has spread like wildfire across the nation, and the populace are shocked."  
ire.63.a:0 "This is horrible. Something must be done about Ulster."

# Unionist Protest March 2
ire.37.t:0 "Unionist Preparations Cause Tensions"
ire.37.d:0 "After a local government representative announced that there would be no official efforts made to prevent the Unionist protest march, local Catholic residents have loudly voiced concerns to the regional Gardaí. They claim that the protest march is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate the Catholic community in Belfast, who find themselves still partially outnumbered by the Protestant, largely Unionist, majority. The demands have not fallen on deaf ears and there is a growing call for the Irish Republican Army to be deployed along the planned march route to protect the Catholic community and make sure things dont get out of hand." 
ire.37.a:0 "We must protect the Catholic minority. They are the true sons and daughters of Éire."
ire.37.b:0 "Deploying the military against our own people? Nonsense. Let the Gardaí handle it."

# Deployment Option Choice

ire.39.t:0 "Who Should Lead The Troops?" 
ire.39.d:0 "The government has decided that a deployment of the Irish Republican Army will be sent to Belfast in order to secure the safety of the Catholic population during the upcoming Unionist protest march. An overall commander of the deployment needs to be decided upon. Eoin O'Duffy and Richard Mulcahy are two of the most prominent figures in the Irish military and it is only natural that the choice should fall between them. O'Duffy, a staunchly conservative Catholic, is known to be a strict commander and an inspiration to his men, whilst Mulcahy is the more balanced option and is likely to cause less of a stir. O'Duffy will deliver a strong message to the Unionists, but he is known to be volatile and his anti-Unionist sentiments are public knowledge. " 
ire.39.a:0 "O'Duffy is the best option we have."
ire.39.b:0 "Mulcahy will keep the situation under control."

# Unionist Protest March 3

It is a miserable day in Belfast, and some had hoped that the torrential rain afflicting the city would have given call for the march to be postponed. Unionist leaders gave the go-ahead however, and the march will continue as planned. The Irish government elected not to deploy military personnel on the streets of Belfast, leaving the monitoring of the protest to the local Gardaí instead."

It is a miserable day in Belfast, and some had hoped that the torrential rain afflicting the city would have given call for the march to be postponed. Unionist leaders gave the go-ahead however, and the march will continue as planned. The Irish government has responded to the concerns of the Catholic minority in Belfast by deploying the 3rd.

# Unionist Protest March 4 
ire.40.t:0 "The Ulster Unionist Protest March"
ire.40.d:0 "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Unionist Protest March went ahead without any trouble breaking out. Whilst there were concerns that the Unionists may turn their frustration into violence, these fears in the end turned out to go unrealised. Whilst this march has proven to be a contentious affair for the nation, at least it didn't result in any bloodshed today. Nonetheless, the Unionists growing demand for independence can no longer be ignored. There must be decisive action to address the question of Ulster, lest the situation grow out of control."
ire.40.d2:0 "Terrible news has spread throughout the country following the Ulster Unionist Protest March. Whilst it is still difficult to understand the full scale of what happened, it is understood that a conflict broke out between the IRA forces commanded by Eoin O'Duffy, and several of the protesters. The resulting violence left many of the protesters dead at the hands of army rifles, and the incident has quickly set the region of Ulster alight in a furore. Some cry for vengeance, others for justice, but one thing is certain: this is a black day for Ireland."
ire.40.d3:0 "Sighs of relief were breathed up and down the country today as the Ulster Unionist Protest March went ahead without serious trouble breaking out. Under the watchful eyes of the Irish Republican Army commanded by Richard Mulcahy, the protesters were escorted through Catholic regions with only minor incidents taking place. The march has been an extremely contentious affair among the public at large and in politics, and many are glad that it has passed by without any serious issues. However, it's clear that the atmosphere in Belfast is a tense one at the moment, and many Unionists did not take kindly to the presence of the military."
ire.40.d4:0 "Violent scenes marred the Ulster Unionist Protest March today as widespread fighting erupted between Unionist protesters and outraged Catholic citizens. It's unclear who threw the first stone or fired the first shot, but several people have been killed and many more injured. This incident is just another worrying sign of the turmoil quickly starting to grow in the north of Ireland. Truly a black day for the nation."
ire.40.a:0 "How could this happen?!"

# Mulcahy Commission

ire.41.t:0 "The Mulcahy Commission" 
ire.41.d:0 "Following the atrocities that occurred during the Ulster Unionist Protest March, the events of which are now coming to be known as 'Bloody Wednesday' by Belfast residents, the government has launched a full investigation into the military's involvement and culpability in the massacre. Led by Richard Mulcahy, the commission has presented their initial report. Mulcahy believes that, contrary to the claims by Eoin O'Duffy and his soldiers, it was not the Unionist protesters who instigated the fatal clashes with the army. Instead, he believes that O'Duffy and his men were looking for a fight all along and later planted weapons on dead protesters to give themselves an alibi. If these allegations are true, it's a shocking revelation and may have wide reaching consequences for the IRA."
ire.41.a:0 "Respect the Commission. O'Duffy and the army were at fault."
ire.41.b:0 "The army were to blame, but O'Duffy couldn't do anything to stop it."

ire.42.d:0 "Eoin O'Duffy has today been brought before a court-martial presided over by the highest chiefs of the Irish Republican Army. He is accused of encouraging, perhaps even personally orchestrating, the massacre of Bloody Wednesday. The consequences of such a direct breach in military protocol are severe. The public have been incensed by the revelations of the Mulcahy Commission and are baying for blood, no more so than in Ulster. It is up to the court to decide whether or not O'Duffy is truly guilty however, and if so, what punishment should be dealt."

# One Shot Tension Increasing Events (Flavour)

ire.43.t:0 "Unionist Workers Clash in Belfast"
ire.43.d:0 "Following the shift in power that occurred when the British were chased out of Ireland, many Catholic business owners rose to prominence in Ulster. However, their rise in socio-economic status came often at cost to the Protestant residents of the region, who had previously enjoyed such unbridled dominance over the Catholic minority. A group of Ulster Unionist factory workers went on strike today citing unfair pay and unwarranted treatment by their Catholic employer. Their strike soon turned violent when they were attacked by what some believe to be hired thugs. Nobody was killed, although Belfast City Hospital had plenty of patients in the immediate aftermath. This will not do the tense situation in Ulster any favours."
ire.43.a:0 "This is worrying."

ire.44.t:0 "Murder in Derry"
ire.44.d:0 "The body of a young man was found this morning in a cold and desolate alleyway near the centre of Derry. According to a follow-up police report, he had been stabbed several times and left for dead. The man was previously known to the local police force as a prominent member of a Unionist volunteers group with local ties in the Waterside. There have already been cries that the murder was committed by a Catholic and that the police will turn a blind eye. However warranted or unwarranted these claims may be, the situation in Ulster is, as ever, volatile."
ire.44.a:0 "Frightening times for Derry."

ire.45.t:0 "Ulster Unionist Party Holds Rally"
ire.45.d:0 "There was a massive turn out this afternoon for a UUP rally held in the city centre of Belfast. Thousands of Ulstermen and women came out in the sunshine to listen to prominent Unionist speakers. There was plenty of time for song and dance, but just as much time for increasingly violent rhetoric regarding the status of Ulster in relation to the rest of Ireland. Whilst the words 'revolt' or 'uprising' might not have been spoken out loud, they were certainly thought. Of great concern to the Irish government will be the sheer number of people attending the rally. Clearly, the Unionist movement enjoys widespread popular support."
ire.45.a:0 "This movement is becoming increasingly popular."

ire.46.t:0 "Concert Hall Attacked in Antrim"
ire.46.d:0 "In the latest shocking incident from Ulster, a concert hall in County Antrim was subjected to a violent attack. Believed to have been carried out by the Protestant dissident group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, the attack saw several members of a Dublin band shot dead, as well as several concert goers. The motivation for the attack is believed to be another act of terrorism against the Irish state, acts that will continue as long as Ulster remains a part of Ireland, according to the movements occasional cryptic communications with the police and the public."
ire.46.a:0 "Awful."

ire.47.t:0 "Reprisal Shootings
ire.47.d:0 "Seemingly in response to the recent violence carried out by the Ulster Volunteer Force, five men with known ties to the group were found dead in a field near a farm twenty miles outside of Belfast. The victims appear to have been executed. It is believed that the men were rounded up during the night and taken together to be killed, although it is unknown at this time who might have orchestrated such an action. The tensions in Ulster are growing as the situation grows more violent, and the Irish government are facing increasing outcry at their apparent inability to address the instability of their nation."
ire.47.a:0 "The cycle of violence continues."

ire.48.t:0 "Craig Speaks Out"
ire.48.d:0 "After several years of inactivity and silence, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party has spoken out regarding the status of Ulster in the Republic of Ireland. James Craig, reported by some to have grown senile in his elder years, appeared lively and in a good mood as he viciously attacked the Irish government in his first major address of such a kind since the ceasefire of 1925. He particularly chastised the regime of Michael Collins and the economic neglect paid towards Ulster during the past decade, and demanded that every son and daughter of Ulster be prepared to fight for the prosperity and, if needs be, freedom of the region."
ire.48.a:0 "He should have kept his mouth shut."

ire.49.t:0 "Belfast City Hall Bombing"
ire.49.d:0 "Terror awaited Belfast as the Belfast City Hall was subjected to a massive bombing that left over fifty people dead and many more injured. The shocking attack appears to be the latest in a long line of escalating UVF attacks, and was carried out during a meeting of local political representatives. Among those killed was Thomas Carlin, local party chief for the National Centre Party. This attack has frightened the nation, and the tension in Ulster has once again reared it's ugly head but this time with devastating consequences."
ire.49.a:0 "The times we live in."

ire.50.t:0 "Grand Opera House Fire"
ire.50.d:0 "Horror at the Grand Opera House in Belfast. Several hundred people had to be evacuated in the midst of the evening’s entertainment when a massive fire broke out, consuming much of the historic hall. Thirty-five people are believed to have died in the disaster and the toll could soon rise, with many still reported missing as search efforts comb through the debris hoping to find any signs of life. It is unknown what caused the fire to break out but the government is already being criticised yet again by Ulster Unionists, who claim the incident could have been avoided had the Opera House been refurbished, as a previous request to the government had suggested."

ire.51.t:0 "Carson Memorial Event"
ire.51.d:0 "Edward Carson, the former leader of the Unionist Party, died last year aged 81. He was an extremely divisive figure whilst alive and fled to England when Ireland gained her independence and took back Ulster. He was particularly reviled outside of Ulster for his persecution of beloved Irish poet and author Oscar Wilde. His memory was venerated today by loyalists in the north of Ireland, who held a memorial service in Belfast with several leading members of the UUP speaking in his name. The memorial attracted quite a crowd, showing that Carson still has power even in death. His spectre is looming over Ulster, just as the tensions and threat of rebellion loom over it as well."
ire.51.a:0 "He's a problem even from the grave."

ire.52.t:0 "Dublin Bombing"
ire.52.d:0 "At 10:30am this morning, a massive explosion went off near the Four Courts in Dublin. Five hundred people are believed dead and many more could follow when an official death count is taken. Two men believed to have been responsible for the bombing were shot dead by the Gardaí as they attempted to flee the scene and put up resistance when asked to stand down. At least one of the men has been identified as a Belfast native with known Unionist ties. This terrifying escalation of the on-going conflict in Ulster is tantamount to a declaration of war upon Ireland and her people, and the public outcry has been enormous. The Irish people are baying for blood, and it is Ulster that may have to pay the price."
ire.52.a:0 "This can't go on."

ire.58.t:0 "Unionists Planning An Uprising?"
ire.58.d:0 "Now that we find ourselves in an unfortunate state of war, there has been an unusual amount of dissent pouring in from the north of Ireland. Ulster Unionists are said to be considering their options whilst the Irish Republican Army is preoccupied with the on-going conflict, and they very well may use this opportunity to try and break free from the Republic. The consequences of such an action could be grave for the nation, as they might very well attempt to align themselves with our enemies and would provide a perfect base for an invasion of Ireland."
ire.58.a:0 "As if we don't have enough problems as it is!"

Our volunteers have been a great asset to the Unionist cause and a step towards securing Ireland, albeit through indirect means. However, now that hostile volunteer forces have joined the Republican forces, it would be fair to say that the civil war in Ireland is not necessarily developing to our advantage. If we were to invest anymore of our own military even as 'volunteers' then it could be seen as a direct act of war by our hostile neighbours in Europe and across the Atlantic. However, if we were to ask the French if they might aid the Ulster cause, promising a new Syndicalist ally once all is said and done, we might be able to swing the conflict back in our interest..."

They have drawn our attention to the ongoing civil war in Ireland, and have suggested that it is in the interest of the Third Internationale and indeed workers around the world that the Republic of Ireland be defeated by the rebels in Ulster. Should the rebels defeat their former oppressors, the English insist that the newly freed Ulster is a ripe plantation in which the seeds of revolution can grow undisturbed. Another Syndicalist ally across the English Channel would be welcome, although some might question whether or not this cause really deserves French support. Agreeing to the request would see Commune forces depart for Belfast and, unofficially of course, aid the Ulstermen in their fight for independence."

A detachment of French 'volunteers' is on their way to Belfast and will very soon arrive on the front lines to help resist the Republican forces.

# France says no 
ire.159.t:0 "The French Decline"

It appears that, apart from our own volunteer forces, the Ulstermen are truly on their own against the superior numbers of the Irish army. We will see the matter out to the bitter end of course, and keep a stiff upper lip about it, but without French aid there are very few guarantees where Ulster is concerned. Barring a full-on declaration of war, we have done as much as we can at this time."

They were greeted by a delegation of British and Unionist military officials, making it quite clear that the French have sent troops to aid the Ulster cause. This is another clear attempt by the Union of Britain to steal Ireland back through a Unionist puppet. The conflict has escalated yet again, but the Irish people will not give up until the matter is put to rest, no matter how much French, English, or Unionist blood needs to be spilled."

We can now set up our own provisional government and rule over Ulster in a fair and just manner, where Irish Protestants will be put first always, and the cause of Unionism can be advanced in peace."
