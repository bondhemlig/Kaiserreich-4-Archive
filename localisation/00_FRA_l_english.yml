In the November of 1919 a revolutionary General Strike was called by the CGT, paralysing the country and causing the downfall of the bourgeois government. ‘The Party of Order’ was not strong enough to put an end to the unrest and in the following months the ‘Establishment’ were forced out of France by a coalition of leftist forces in a brief but brutal civil war. \n For the past 15 years the self styled ‘Commune of France’ has united behind a common platform of Syndicalist-Socialist consensus, headed by the ruling Comit? de Salut Public. However, by 1936 the consensus that was resolved to rebuild the shattered country and defend the fruits of revolution from foreign menace is deemed as outdated by many critics, and there is a growing call for more radical policies. France is increasingly confident in its security and in its mission, but the French revolutionary tradition is varied, and it is unclear precisely which strands shall become dominant in the years to come..."

In the South, the American First Committe is stronger than the Central Government and the North is suffering from a depression as the West Coast prospers.

This committee, with the help of Mirsa Sultan-Galiev, an infamous Tatar Bolshevik, is coordinating the efforts made by the Syndicalists in gaining the sympathy of Muslims everywhere. The Syndicalist powers have sent significant amounts of weapons and material to support the left-wing partisans in Turkey, Syria and Iraq. They have also opened a few training camps. To counteract this activity, we could declare Jihad against International. This appeal won't solve our problems, but it could be used in propaganda towards the Arabs populace of the Ottoman state.

Now, he is known by  no less than thousands of Frenchmen. At this point, imprisoning him would be seen as an act of brutality and make him a martyr.
