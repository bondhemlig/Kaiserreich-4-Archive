Thank you for downloading Kaiserreich for Hearts of Iron 4!
This is alpha version 0.9.2.
This version is compatible with 1.6.2, it may work with later hot fixes, but it is not guaranteed.

Manual Installation Instructions
1) Download the mod
2) Delete the former version if you have one
3) Extract the .zip to 'Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod'
4) Move Kaiserreich.mod out of 'Hearts of Iron IV\mod\Kaiserreich' and into 'Hearts of Iron IV\mod'
5) Enable the mod in the Launcher mod menu and enjoy!

Don't worry about Kaiserreich Dev Build.mod, sadly it doesn't unlock super secret new features, it just lets us run release and dev versions together more easily for testing.
